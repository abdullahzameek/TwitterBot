I found this article interesting as it discussions the ethnic diversity among the Emirati population their cultural roots and the way that citizenshipmuch more than color or heritagedefines More Emiratis and their selfperception as Arab At least to an extent as it touches on how discrimination still occurs No points to make here just some interesting reading for those of us who know little on this and perhaps a good conversation starter for the Emirati students on campus to share their perspective httpswwwopendemocracynetbeyondslaverybtsanonymousthemultiplerootsofemiratiness
This is definitely the wrong forum but I dont want any pseudocriticisms made on my intentions on sharing this Just thought it was a good read

I graduated two years ago from a pretty good university in America Im still unemployed I moved back in with my parents and I have no idea what Im doing with my life I often come to NYUAD for events but it always brings back memories of my negative experience in college I had no friends or relationships and I was so so alone in a big More city Only now I realize that I was suffering from severe depression and anxiety And I mean locking myself up in my dorm for days bingeing drinking crying talking to myself avoiding classes large crowds public transportation My only human contact was through hookup apps that left me hating myself more Even though im a bit healthier now More

I think the idea behind the candidate weekend is insignificant it raises students egos so much and creates such a sense of devastation in the ones who were not invited If they truly and really want to hold a candidate weekend they should do so after the final decision of acceptance or rejection has been received in order to give More students a taste of how life is really like and explore the campus So really if that is what they want why not do it to the students who will be accepted what is the point of giving so much hope to a student when theres a slight chance that theyll be rejected
Im already drained off completely graduating in about two months and I have no idea what Im doing next Its sometimes better not to have a plan than having one and something going wrong last minute Great But thinking how 70 of 2019 Class does not have jobs secured is scary market here is going down professors rejecting us for More research saying youre graduating in May bring your own funding and I can employ you dude for f sake really Am I going to ask you to employ me knowing that Im graduating and have no money
Why are some people professors so inhumane Its not that Im complaining its me trying to be realistic they were once in our shoes and need More

I finally found the courage to share this even if anonymously Ever since I got on campus I cant seem to connect in a significant way with other people from my country I always feel left behind unnoticed ignored unwanted misunderstood and out of place when being in their company as if I cant seem to contribute anyhow to the More conversations in the group we have or at least this is how I perceive it I struggle enormously with interacting with them communicating and sharing any kind of personal experience with them as I dont feel they will or want to understand me Every timewhether I am with them or on my own I always seem to compare myself to each of them and put myself More

I feel like Im trapped here at NYUAD because Im a different person here and a different person anywhere else Im very anxious stressed lonely and exhausted at the end of the day I really enjoyed my Jterm and the people I was surrounded with We never stressed over course work even though our class was intense Similar to my study away More I always had anyone beside me and was excited for every new day Its very different here Ive joined SIGs and go to events yet Im trapped in campus Everyone is always busy and hardly find time to hang out Ive gone through depressions and counselors and that has helped but I barely can go beyond that although I wake up positive and ready to take on the day Is there anyone in a similar situation What makes this place different in the negative sense compared to others
Overheard at NYUAD Are your professors like mentally stable
Am I the only one There are a number of professors whom I wont call out by name that put their personal work above their students I struggled with this problem so much in the past and I didnt know how to approach it Some professors were too busy traveling working on their own papers or research this made it extremely hard to reach More out to them In many situations it resulted in affecting my own grades and entirely changed my academic path and was only told to let it go in the end But why is the blame that influences our grades in the end always put on the student when there is more to follow on This is considering that the student is partly in the wrong but not the full 100 percent But wouldnt it mean that because it wasnt the students fault entirely that more couldve been done Did anyone else encounter this before
I knew this was gonna happen but now Im freaking out Last fall was a terrible semester for me mental health wise I know I did terribly and I was in touch with HW and the dean of students office over it But I just got a letter saying I am 8 credits behind and on probation and I would be considered for dismissal or suspension if I dont get Cs and above this spring I really dont want to lose the opportunity that NYUAD is due to stuff that was outside my control What does all this mean Was anyone in a similar situation before

As a student trying to secure an internship or a job I am starting to find it odd and intimidating to ask current students and alumni about their current and previous professional experiences Some people are very friendly However some think I am literally exploiting them for my benefit while I wouldnt care about them otherwise I was More told that explicitly The truth is I am not using anyone here I am also happy to help anyone in need I simply cannot keep in touch with everyone on a regular basis which seems to be a requirement if you ever need help in the future Any advice
So are we just not going to talk about the crippling anxiety and completely debilitating sensation that comes with senior year I feel paralyzed by such a deep fear when I think about graduation and what happens after I cant be the only senior feeling this way can I Why isnt anyone talking about this Im fucking terrified
I strongly agree with 3361 Our school invests way too much capital and effort in trying to promote its presence and the narrative that NYU Abu Dhabi is a revolutionary liberal arts college Our significance and contribution to society should be felt passively and naturally not through associating big names with us The school may be avoiding popular news sources like Gloria Borger and Poppy Harlow but arent differing opinions and contradicting narratives the reason we are here in the first place

Im certain someone posted this before but I need to do it again Just because Im Emirati doesnt mean Im brainwashed Honestly Im so triggered every time someone says tries to convince me that my country is this awful hellhole and we should GTFO or try to make it better We havent been around very long but were changing at a More faster pace than any of yalls countries are considering our extremely conservative origins so I honestly think were not doing too badly I dont think my beliefs were influenced by propaganda so either kindly STFU or GTFO
I hate when I have to talk about NYUAD to other people When they ask if Ive been on every continent my answer is yes and I feel shame Also I hate myself for even writing this this is the most fucking privileged first world problem Ive ever heard It has been wonderful to get the opportunity to travel so much something that no one in More my family has the ability to do I have learned and experienced so much and I have a far more open and thoughtful mind than I would otherwise have But now Im questioning has it really been worth it I cant talk about this huge significant part of my life without feeling like a piece of shit and if I dont talk about it I feel like Im hiding More
I really dont understand how we have had names such as Mike Pompeo Bill Clinton Tony Blair etc visit NYUAD but we havent had internationally renowned journalist Gloria Borger To be honest seems like a disservice to me I would much rather she speak at graduation than at least half of the other speakers and I think her unique take on international events is something that could really add to the discussion at NYUAD

How do you deal with professors who are dismissive but only towards certain students not you By dismissive I mean my professor would often interrupt this girl in my class midsentence refuse to take questions from her and always have something to say against her opinions despite the fact they seem to reflect the classs take on the issue

Note from admin Happy holidays guys Confessions wishes you a happy and restful break ❤️
Exam anxiety is the most real thing I have ever had to deal with and yet people do not understand how much this impacts both my academia and my mental health On average during the semester I would usually have an A or A average for all my courses and then a final exam or test comes my way and suddenly my grades would drop from As and More As to Bs and Cs Its very disheartening and demotivating to deal with blows to my grades because of 1 exam that weighs 40 of my final grade The problem usually is not whether I have studied enough or not because I feel like I know the material to these subjects by heart at this point but end up doing bad on tests because I keep getting More
Last semester was such a disappointment in terms of classes All my professors were disorganized and did not care Classes had no structure and examspapers had nothing to do with lectures Seeing my professors not putting any effort killed my motivation to work In short I learnt nothing
I keep barely passing all my classes that count toward my major requirement I love my major I really do But I dont think I can do this in the future if Im this bad at it How do I have a future if I get C all the time How am I going to do anything if all I worry about it is whether or not I will pass this class How will I ever prove More that I am a better person than a C if thats the first thing people see in my transcript I know I should have worked harder done better but really I cried most of the days this semester because I was barely handling all the things that were on my plate At then end of the day Im just making excuses for what I did I dont even know why Im submitting this to confessions I have no idea why the school accepted me in the first place and Im pretty sure it was a mistake I wanted to do good things for this world As idealistic and dumb it sounds I wanted to make this world a better place doing what I loved I dont think I can do that anymore I am so tired

Overheard at D2 smells worksheet This worksheet smells so nice This is what my professor smells like smells worksheet again
Its actually annoying how people in Arts and Humanities constantly try to prove that their majors are as hard and challenging as STEM majors Yall struggle but your worst case scenario is like getting a C in a paper while people in STEM in NYUAD are constantly worried about passing their courses although they spend all their days More studying A lab in fos is worth 2 credits and sometimes less and you need to spend 16 credits worth of time to do all your assignments for lab Lets not even mention how lenient professors in almost all departments but STEM You miss a deadline youre dead and you dont even bother explaining to your professors because they wont listen or accept your late assignment And btw Im not trying to prove that one major is more important than the other but its unfair how easy it is for nonSTEM students to get good grades and have high GPAs while we struggle to get that C
Someone has to say it I am a GIRL and I HATE this hook upmake out culture I do not like absolutely every concept linked to it It drives me crazy to see girls allowing thirsty guys to use their body Why do you give you beautiful feminine energy love and passion to them why do you open up to someone who wont care about you Its so More freaking common for guys on campus to not even acknowledge girls existence afterward Why Because once your 10 minutes hook up is over youre just another done right swipe hopefully wellcooked at least and a new tick on his list of wonderful college experience Congratulations Now it is likely he will tell his friends how he hooked up with you and that girl that sits over the next table in the library I know it might be very hard to live without hooking up but please let us stop this hoeing games ON CAMPUS I dont want every guy I meet here ultimately think Im down for no strings attached thing just because I live amongst the majority who does it

Today is my birthday and while I appreciate and am endlessly grateful for the people who wished me and spent time with me I did expect some more attention on the one day in my year that kinda want it I understand that its finals and I usually dont expect anything out of people but it still sucks sitting here and scrolling through posts More of other peoples birthdays and how their friends bought them cake and threw them surprise parties and all and being saddened by the fact that no one cared enough to do that for me even thought Ive done that for others so many times Im too old to care about birthdays and I know that there are other things that show how much people care better than this but I still cant help but feel sad

The Christmas Tree in the D2 Entrance is as poorly decorated as the food variety available In D2 itself Its like a symbolic representation of what were supposed to expect when getting food Dont get me wrong and dont tell me take it or leave it the point Im trying to make is that we have same options for food every few days four More weeks a month four months per semester and four academic years in total As someone who respects ADNH and the Dining Committee this fault falls on ADNH because I know how hard people involved in the committee are trying their best to address our issues and improve the situation Happy Holidays xoxo
I am a guy and I have long wanted to talk about how candidly people talk about freely cheating on their significant half on this campus How it is just about physical contact and have 0 respect for their long distance relationship I want yall to know that Ive got a damn good girl half way accross globe and sometimes its a real stress More buster to have someone outside the nyuad circle because I can vent about this campus and not have to worry about it travelling back lol She has total and complete trust in me and I absolutely thrive off it and what Im trying to say ladies and gents on this campus is that it is cool to actually be faithful and respectful to your partner It is not being pussy whipped as some may term it Honestly some of my fellow dudes who brag about numbers and their conquests on campus Are appalling How did your mam raise you man And yes ladies faithful guys like us do in fact exist

REACH is honestly such a joke Aside from The Nook what even do you guys do Like I care about mental health and stuff too but the ineffectiveness of this group just surprises me And its annoying how much praise they get on this campus when I personally dont even feel remotely impacted by whatever work they do A dialogue isnt the More solution to everything and is getting people a couple dogs to play with really all you have to do to be loved by this community Youll be hearing from my anonymous feedback submission so dont bother commenting about it here

TRIGGER WARNING EATING DISORDERS Its honestly so annoying how they have been treating eating disorders here Weve been told to wait until the nutritionist comes on campus for the past 4 months every time they tell us that she will be here soon and now they arent sure she can come at all Do they realize how harmful that is to have an More eating disorder left untreated If the nutrionist cant come they need to provide other outlets for help rather than just telling us to wait for someone who might not even come What happens when eating disorders get so bad that we cant wait anymore
People on this campus have been so shitty to me about my weight As openminded as we all preach to be but the number of days where I get a shitty comment made about my weight says otherwise And not just about me but the amount of shit I hear about other girls weight too

I dont know anymore if it is that I just keep pushing my limits every semester beyond what I can handle or if have been becoming less and less able to handle my workload and sanity as the years go by Im currently in New York and I feel my environment here has only made everything more difficult Im struggling with my academics my More relationship figuring out my future I have to keep postponing tasks from my part time job and I dont feel I have time to myself anymore Now finals are coming and for the first time I am panicking in the most real and literal sense And somehow I feel if I went back in time to my first semester I would have the energy and passion I now lack and I would breeze through all this I know only I can change my situation but I dont know how Ive tried talking endlessly with the people closest to me but it hasnt helped With counselors its always a different person and I just feel I have to tell the same story over and over again and get no really useful advice I really want to get my sht together

Capstone is the biggest bullshit ever some students put so much effort because their professors require them to produce PhD work while others are chilling and do the minimum amount of work because their professors dont really care and in the end those who worked hard get B and C and those who basically didnt do anything get A Well this is really unfair I didnt want to post this on forum for privacy issues but I feel this should be addressed so that we together can find ways for resolving it

Starting my study away application earlier thinking about it before this weekend or even glancing at the questions before today could have made this long weekend really enjoyable But here I am trying to come up with 4 other factors that contributed to my global education for the past 35 minutes
I want to be organizing activities I want to be part of StuGov and help shape this place I want to be part of the group improving NYUAD every day But I am afraid I am not the person for that I get tired very quickly from social situations and organizing events or any kind of activities even meetings would consume too much of my energy I More would need a lot more rest after that cutting down my study time even more and I am afraid affecting how well I do in school I am constantly drawn between these two wishes wanting to make a difference but also wanting a comfortable environment and good grades Anyone in a similar situation
This may be repetitive but the left leaning people here can be quite a nuisance You voice one conservative and even completely different opinion and they all think youre a criminal and synonymous with Hitler What happened to multiple perspective discussions
Love in the times of UNIX lab
Can someone explain to me why anyone thought that putting a black person and kfc together in a cartoon was a good idea Maybe it was not intentionally racist but all it does is reinforce our biases and subtle assumptions of the attributes of certain races We can do better global leaders
I give NYUAD four more years of existence five at most before NYU pulls out and it becomes American University of Abu Dhabi
Overheard on the Highline I couldnt sleep at all last night Oh is that because you take 62 depression naps a day
 NYUAD Students Please better investigate sexual assault allegations Administration Uhm yeah sure One student Putting a black person and KFC in the same frame is racist Admin omg youre right gazelle takE DOWN THE CARTOON
Fighting over standardized testing scores on freshman is the most idiotic thing I can think of right now These tests are so not accurate at all ACTs and SATs are sometimes completely new to nonus applicants and unless you attended a rich high school you probably never heard of them What does it really measure anyway I know people who More have done AMAZING things on their fields and didnt get stellar ACTSAT scores and I am talking about 25s and 1250s VS Actual publications amazing research and unimaginable university programs But what do they have Dedication integrity passion and curiosity It really makes me mad that people on campus argue about how the University level More
I do not think it is safe to be at the university especially with all the sexual harassment going around If I write more my identity will be revealed thats why we need to stop the nonsense happening at my building Loud parties too many drinks then its not even safe to be out of your room at night
At this point I wont be surprised if D2 comes up with this new soup called Cream of Table
Dating someone at uni is nice and all until you realise you know the people they hang around with and have to do your best to be nice when you see them and you see them often enough surprisingly but youll shiv a bitch that gets within a 2 metre radius of your significant other tbh
Whoever wrote that STEM vs humanities article you cant compare two majors as a whole Compare aspects of it like CASE 1 Time in class While 80 of humanities majors sit in 25 hours of class for 4 credits 80 of STEM majors have 5 hours of class Labs for the same 4 credits This does make life harder for STEM majors as they dont More have AS MUCH time to commit to things they like or are passionate about No one said humanities is lesser we just say STEM takes up more of your time 
CASE 2 Number of requirements STEM tends to have way more example SRPP 14 biology 17 engineering 21 Imagine this coupled with the extra hours of class 
Case 3 Readings STEM does More
Dear crush if you wont ask me out soon I will block your account and forget your name Its been almost a semester of pointless messenger communication intense eye contact and you popping up in places where I usually go to Boy if youre too shy to really approach me I aint got no time for stressing over you in the upcoming finals week So think twice Please
Everyone talks about how difficult it is to be an average student here but what about being told your whole life that youre so tall only to find out that your height is pretty average
NYUAD is ruining my life one email at a time and I dont even go to this uni dont me
To whoever wrote the FYD article on the Gazelle please know that its the most inconsiderate and biased thing Ive ever read on that website When you write an article you should be aware of what other people think about that issue and who it is going to affect after being published Despite the fact that there are people who are not a More big fan of FYD there are also people who think its one of the best programs NYUAD has ever designed Labeling something that numerous people worked on to give students a smooth transition as artificial is very maddening Unlike some of you there are people including myself who actually enjoyed their FYD and met their true friends there FYRCE My FYDs peer facilitator and Fellow FYDers I love you all
I had a really bad experience last year with an RA that left me feeling unsafe in my own dorm building It took a huge toll on my mental health and it prevented me from getting proper sleep because I didnt feel safe or comfortable I didnt feel like I could tell anyone because I was scared of retaliation and everyone else thought this RA could do no wrong Now Im scared that Ill have to deal with the same thing when I return to campus next semester and I dont know what to do
Before coming to uni I felt average af and I was totally okay with that I didnt come to NYUAD to become the next global leader or idk Oprah HOWEVER NOW we have a problem a few months have passed and im feeling very below average Idk man I just want to sleep like 258 but im counting my blessings so its fine I guess
Sometimes I really wish that we could all forget that we are students and enjoy the process of learning something new It sucks that assignments and projects take the joy out of learning in some classes
I am a student currently on a leave of absence I have been struggling with bulimia for 3 months now I have not mustered the courage to have this talk with my family yet and I am having a hard time coping with it on my own I really dont fancy dying of a torn esophagus so I would really appreciate any kind of help from anyone who has been in this position at some point Thanks and lots of love ❤
Its so fucked up that most people here attend events only because of the free food Its so disheartening to put so much effort into planning events coordinating people booking rooms fixing technical issues and so many other things only to have people come for 10 minutes grab food and leave I mean good food is a plus for sure but arent student events supposed to be all about interest But alas even for that people here are so shallow smh
Still quite triggered about the class of 2021 tshirt and how it is absolutely not abayafriendly lol
Can someone remind me of the purpose of ROR Cause recently it has been flushed with a tons of tickets selling and other sales stuffs that have nothing to do with the university Why dont we have a dedicated group for just these kinds of sales advertisement The thing about having too much of these sales stuffs is that they just displace other announcements and stuffs that are actually related to the university
It has been one day since Confessions posted 3267 my post Its true that I should have been straight forward but the person I intended to see it did and they didnt mention it but I could tell the way they acted changed for the better I hope every person who asked is this about me treated the person they are with better if you love More them or were honest with them if there are certain things you need to talk about that you have been putting off Maybe this should be on crushes and compliments but thanks to the confessions page for making things that much better by providing a platform to say things that are sometimes too scary to say
Help What do you do to the suitemate that constantly leaves their dirty dishes on the counter eats her suitemates food without asking overloads the fridge with strong smelling food and never throws their food away even after they are rotten leaves a huge mess in the bathroom and expects her suitmates to just clean everything after them How do we surprise them with the fact that we are only their suitemates and not their nannies
Just because there are Emiratis who date nonemiratis in this campus Doesnt mean all Emiratis would want to date nonemiratis This is not racism and I am sick of people telling me Oh we feel sorry for you you do not have the freedom to love anyone It is my preference to marry someone who has the same culture religion and ethnic background as me I want to raise my kids in this country I will accept if my kids would want to marry nonemiratis but I dont want to marry a nonemiratis
Someone used to love me very much I still love them very much I know they will read this here and Im too scared of the answer to ask them this outright 
I dont think its the same for you anymore Not the way you talk to me not the way you hold my hand or even look at me You dont call me when Im away like you used to The late More nights when I felt down and broken and you could feel it and your voice made it all better You told me a few weeks ago you didnt want it the way it was anymore When you said that I thought you meant the bad but you meant all of it I dont get the anger from you anymore but I dont get the love either I thought you were trying to keep yourself from getting too close but I think youre trying to be close in a way you dont feel anymore I love you the same way I did the first November If you dont feel the same way anymore just tell me I wont want to hear it but I tried to love someone after I didnt love them anymore remember It didnt work
I am conducting a research on educational opportunities privileges by nationality and income level Does anyone know how I can find NYUAD acceptance rate for Emirati students Too scared people might call me a racist if I ask this publicly
Im falling for her and she is leaving for NY in the spring What do I do
I believe there should be more events for seniors in more exciting locations than Torch Club Common guys who organize this step up your game So far so sad
This campus feels so fuckin small when you constantly bump into your ex your exs ex your roommates ex and your exs roommatesfriends
NYUAD life is living with all your friends on a 1km wide desert island campus and still managing to not see each other for 3 days straight because everyones busy all the time
Dont know if this is the appropriate place to post this but I hate to post under my own name so here goes Can people with flashing fairy lights in their room please close their curtains I was still feeling the effects of a killer migraine and the flashing was not helping the least bit Sorry if this sounds stupid or petty its such a small thing but it got to me
 NYUAD student NYUAD has anything that you may want when looking for a university NonNYUAD student What about freedom of speech
Why cant I read critical comments on 3244 Is it just me or no one cant read it Was it filtered by the admin
Overheard on the Highline I always undress without closing my curtains I dont care for anyone who sees me its like saying Merry Christmas
Is it normal to feel lazy or unmotivated to do your work even though its stuff you generally loveenjoy doing
Just wanted to point out that the treatment of the fish in the CDC is absolutely barbaric At least two of the poor dears were stuck in the filter someone let in a beta fish with the rest of them and several were mourning their friend in a corner 
If theyre committed to keep such a massive and quite frankly pointless aquarium could More they at least read up on how to take care of it Or get rid of it altogether At this point with the amount of misery swimming there the fish would feel happier back at the pet shop
Please have some humanity
Can we lowkey make knowing peoples names those who you havent met normal I know a lot of peoples names bc I remember them from CW Marhaba or social media and I keep forgetting that some people might remember and life is just plain awkward
Overheard at the East Plaza Are we biologically wired to like babies so that we dont eat them
The only thing thats harder than fos is turning off the light in classrooms
People who hold doors open for other people you have my love 
What exactly happens if you tell the counselor here that youre suicidal It sucks because when you are you cant talk to anyone about it and if you talk about it to your counselor then theyll have to report it and admin and the government dont take that kind of thing lightly read send you home for the semester so you can commit suicide away from them
I have a bit of a moral dilemma and am reaching in case anyone has experience with this My boyfriend and I have been together for around 4 years now were both seniors and he is perfect in every way imaginable but he has had some problems which were and still are out of my control such as mental health issues which I cant disclose here More and other severe health issues for the past two years problems that I can honestly no longer emotionally handle Its so draining to me that I feel that I should rather end it because I cant be there for him and focus on uni because I am anyways no help and we will not be together next year But I do love him and cant continue seeing him hurt What should I do
I cant believe the senior class has to pay for our own graduation robes this year That shit is expensive budgetcuts
Im reaching out through this post because I need some advice My boyfriend and I have gotten together in freshman year and have stayed together till now our senior year He is perfect in every regard and has always been therefore me and I love him a lot But in the last two years he became both physically and as a collateral damage also More mentally ill As I said I love him a lot but I just dont know how to be there for him anymore Im just done I cant balance my senior year and being there properly That makes me think its unfair to him and I want to break up but then again I dont want to just leave him in this state Im helpless
Why Russian and Caribbeanthemed days in the Meal Club They are sooo disgusting Why not Thai Korean Spanish or even German instead These are nice cuisines that everyone likes
I find it harder and harder to balance the time I spend taking care of myself and the time I spend taking care of others This semester has been difficult for me and I feel stuck between not wanting to tell people Im miserable because thats mine to decide to share and I just dont want to and responding to people who need emotional More support Im in a place right now where I just dont care and any empathetic response I have to muster is forced and fake I think these people deserve better than what I can give them right now I also think its unfair for someone to demand emotional support from me if I have never required it of them and have been there for them several times But I also feel really guilty and shitty I really wish I could be there for people more I just dont know how to anymore
Is wanting to be there for myself more than wanting to be there for other people who Im not really close to either so bad If it is and Im willing to accept it is how do I support people while supporting myself without feeling anxious and overwhelmed Am I just selfish
How do I make friends who dont make use of me Im not white I dont look good and in fact I probably look very intimidating despite being a nice person Im always ready to help anyone in need and I always always go out of my way too but sometimes I just need someone or some people to be around me I dont need them to help me with More anything but I just would appreciate their company which would mean a lot to me Kind of tired of being misunderstood by everyone including in class its not my fault that Im smart Im not trying to be and in no way do I try to show off or make anybody else feel small and Im very careful about that Of course I come from a different culture and I More
I have never understood how you can be called a racist if you criticize Islam Islam is a religion and a religion is a belief system It has nothing to do with race You dont choose to be black or white however you do choose which religion you subscribe to Its a choice you make and a choice you will be held responsible for Its not racist to criticize a religion built on injustice and patriarchal structures its common sense
How can you call NYUAD diverse when everyone in the student body went to a high school 
I think NYUAD as a whole could benefit if some of the discussions on here were picked up and continued constructively and respectfully elsewhere Some posts hit on some really important issues about the existence of NYUAD in the UAE but unfortunately their point and their merit is buried in anything from convoluted anecdotes to outright More bigotry and I think were really missing out on an opportunity to discuss important issues that a university must address as frankly and openly as possible with obvious limitations and the understanding that some information will probably never be disclosed publicly like agreements between the government and the university what was discussed More
FRIENDS I have been at this uni for YEARS and I still cant find the perfect combo to make a wrap in GrabnGo Would love it if people posted their personal recipes
I feel like the university is increasingly admitting more and more cats as the years go by and they make up 69 of the mamallian resident body the majority I understand that this is their country of origin and we wouldnt be saying anything However if the idea of this university is to be biodiverse I think increasing the cat intake More isnt a good thing I know for a fact that most of them eat scraps of posh D2 food when noone is looking and live in pretty comfortable bushes which doesnt really add to the diversity of experiences at this school I know cockroaches that have survived pesticide epidemics geckos whove created infrastructures for addressing problems in their More
please read the whole thing 3 Do people actually fail classes at this university I am a frshman and I feel as though Im the worst at this campus I was a major overachiever all my life but it came at the cost of anxiety depression and an eating disorder that combined with family related events left me broken by the end of highschool I More am learning to prioritize my mental health I no longer pull off all nighters prioritize self care etc and I am still healing from things which means I need to take things really slow but still putting my best effort into academics within whats reasonable and all things considered I am the happiest I have been in years and I am determined to More
As a graduate from NYUAD I understand how difficult it can be to maintain relationships because of the workload and study aways but trust me if you really like someone go for them and everything else will work itself out My favorite memories at NYUAD was when I was studying with my girlfriend and we were supporting each other with our More individual goals and dreams So guys and girls I can say with confidence dont let academics get in the way of your feelings for someone your university life shouldnt only be about academics its about the people you meet and the relationships you make
Overheard at the Baraha I want to eat Korean food Whats stopping you Mmm my bank account
Believe all women means that any female student can falsely accuse me of rape and ruin my future
Can we actually stop posting photos of peoples lost ID I mean appreciate all the effort and kindness but a simple tag or mentioning of the name would do Its a small campus and people are incredibly easy to locate Please just be considerate that some people might not feel comfortable with such a post
Overheard D2 Maybe hes from British You know how the Indians colonized British
Overheard on the Highline I am considering becoming religious I will follow whichever God will help me write my capstone
Ive been struggling a lot with selfcompassion and vulnerability lately Before the fall semester began I decided to make the conscious effort to prioritize my mental health because I realized how much I neglected it the previous year It was so easy to bury my emotions because of the workcommitments I had I feel like I have made More progress in some ways and for that I am very happy but now I feel very stuck and I dont know how to move forward
One aspect in particular is that I am unable to let people that I am gay The first people I ever came out to were my parents and they didnt take it very well I was 16 at the time and both sides said some pretty mean things I was scared More
Maybe its just me but its quite saddening to see class of 2022s standardized test scores drop significantly from those of the previous cohorts If NYUAD is lowering admissions standards to increase diversity and student body size now what will it become 3 5 or 10 years later No offense at all to the freshmen in fact a big welcome to you all but as a member of this magnificent institution and community Im genuinely concerned whether it can withstand the challenge of time
Anyone else concerned that the university is becoming less selective Every other university saw an increase in selectivity and test scores in the 2017 cycle but median SAT scores at NYUAD have fallen from 1510 to 1440 Meritocracy is is becoming less important perhaps due to an increased emphasis on diversity
NYUAD students be like
I feel like the university is increasingly admitting more and more Emiratis as the years go by and they make up 15 of the student body the majority I understand that this is their country of origin and we wouldnt be saying anything about too many Americans being accepted at an American institution However if the idea of this More university is to be diverse I think increasing the Emirati intake isnt a good thing I know for a fact that most of them attended posh international schools and come from a pretty comfortable background which doesnt really add to the diversity of experiences at this school I know people who have survived war zones people whove created startups for More
NYUAD students Can I breathe ResEd Breathing will result in a fee of 100 USD per Applications
Its really concerning that we only have one fulltime counsellor in the Health and Wellness Center I tried to make an appointment today because I was having a rough time and the only free appointment More slots are in seven days time Im aware of the recent Gazelle article that addressed this issue but isnt it problematic that a similar article was published in 2014 httpswwwthegazelleorgissue45newshealthandwellness Both times the issue was the licensing process Considering that its been four years since this problem first arose one would assume that university learned how to deal with it I greatly appreciate the effort made by Reach and other student support groups however these programs do not work for everyone since some of us prefer to meet with a counsellor I feel powerless because I do not know what we as students could do to push this forward
My mentalphysical health is in the shitter by this point but I dont know how to bring it up with people I feel like my friends know but never ask me about it for whatever reason I also feel like my professors shouldnt know about it but at the same time they expect certain resultsupdates about my capstone and Im simply not able to deliver so they end up thinking I dont care
Global leaders ™ be like
Its funny how nobody called out John Sexton for explicitly saying in his talk yesterday that this goes for both genders implying that there are only two genders and similar things like Gentlemen they women are just better than us implying that gender is binary but if literally anyone else on campus says something like that they get ostracized and pillared by the social justice warriors Just goes to show our hypocrisy or the shallowness of our convictions
The penalty for missing the consent zone training is literally worse than for actually assaulting someone on campus lolol
I came here eager for meaningful conversations and understanding the world a little bit better But somehow we all have managed to fall into our daily life routines caring about food and parties and complaining about homework forgetting the bigger picture with discussions popping out rarely here and there from time to time If we the best More of the best behave so carelessly so ordinary and so nonselfcritically how can we ever believe that the world can be a better place And is it even worth it going out of our own comfort zones why and who do we make a better place for
Thank you for your kind comments on my post 3314 Update my girlfriend said yes and I cant believe it I can now call the beautiful girl I talked to in the NYUAD dining hall three years ago my fiancée and it feels crazy knowing that I almost didnt approach her because I was so nervous I hope all of you can experience the current love and happiness I have at the moment the men of nyuad dont assume a girl youve never spoken to is uninterestedinterested in you take a chance ask talk to her
Advice to current students from an alumnus please dont be afraid to talk to the girl you like even one youve never even spoken to before I did and now weve been together for three years I am going to propose to her tonight

Ive been having hyperpigmentation problems since high school leading to darker spotsmarks in some parts of my body like in my armpits Ive been using skin whitening creams like the one mentioned in NYUAD Forum since freshman year A while ago I made a request to the Convenience Store and I was so thankful that they made the product More available Im sorry if my request made people uncomfortable that wasnt my intention Overall I find our community very supportive but it makes me feel sad when people assume things Context matters
Overhead at D2 Ive been to more consent trainings than Ive had sex on this campus
I feel extremely sad about The Gazelles recent article about ethnic cliques and heres why 
I come from a place where it takes a huge effort to learn about other cultures because nearly everybody is local Its not easy for us to travel abroad and not many immigrants come either And reading travel blogs or watching documentaries on More YouTube cant possibly be compared to making new friends in person Witnessing all their emotions as they tell you about their countries and customs having them teach you random phrases in their languages sharing your favorite songs from home with each other Think of it in economic terms if you will This knowledge is a precious resource that one More
I was going to write a Why NYU Abu Dhabi Shouldnt Exist in response to Why NYU Tel Aviv Shouldnt Exist but then realized there isnt enough political freedom and expression in the country to be able to do so
The recent Gazelle article on NYU Tel Aviv truly stunned me I am by no means a supporter of Israel but advocating for the invalidation of the global site located there is both hypocritical and counterproductive There is no denying that Israel in more ways than one has subjugated the Palestinian people but several questions arise from More the articles proposal By what metric does Israel stand out as one of the most extreme cases of human rights abusers amongst the countries hosting NYU global sites Does NYUs presence within a country serve as an endorsement for that countrys actions Would the closure of NYU Tel Aviv remedy the situation in any way As the author pointed More
Im frankly done with white men whining about the potential exclusion of their kind and functioning under the naive assumption that every race gender and class around them is treated equally and functioning under this assumption because we go to a supposedly diverse university
Yes John Sexton and Al Bloom brought this school to life More and gave it so much progress and I am beyond grateful I am an NYUAD student now because of them But lets not forget that people in power and statures of authority are and should be representative of those they lead and in this search for a new Vice Chancellor it is opportune time to do that The search for a new more representative and diverse leader doesnt and shouldnt undermine the work of Sexton and Bloom but should push it forward in a way that achieves the world they are trying to create a diverse and representative one
Plot twist the dissonance post was written by Sexton Or Bloom as his honest goodbye speech Or a girl on drugs in NYC Who knows
I am a recent grad and currently looking for jobs I have realized a few things that I wish I had realized sooner in my senior year so I am publishing this in hopes that it helps someone right now
1 Starting off with your resume please get it reviewed by multiple people I made the mistake of just sticking to a couple of people in More addition to visiting the Career Centre I dont think there is anything wrong with the career centres help but it always helps to get it reviewed 
2 If you are serious about consulting jobs please start preparing for case interviews early If you wait till you get an interview call it will be too late and youll end up passing on a great opportunity More
I am currently spending my semester abroad at NYUAD and I noticed one amazing thing that isnt as common in NYU campus in New York surprisingly the amount of interracial couples I think it is so special to see how different cultures can integrate together and form relationships Your college years at NYUAD are extremely unique Treasure them form relationships explore do not take them for granted
Opinion The Rise and Fall of NYUAD Dissonance
As Im sitting here in my apartment in NYC waiting for my food to arrive I decided to write this little text to all the past current and future NYUAD citizens be it a student faculty or admin While I decide to remain anonymous I am an alumna of NYUAD who was there when the fancy More campus didnt exist and NYUAD felt more like a summer camp of a few hundred people rather than a small liberal university in the few thousands Back in the day Sexton was our leader in flesh and blood and in NYUAD rather than the contemporary acrosstheocean ideological messiah

I love that the WiFi has been exceedingly worse than any semester before and yet students arent complaining about it because were too busy fighting for properly working dining halls
Can you guys fucking understand that youre in the UAE and theres supposed to be some respect for the culture in your clothing You knew that coming here dont start crap about freedom and your body autonomy If you had half a brain you would at least put a shirt on and stop walking around with your entire body exposed or better yet in a place that prohibits it
Overheard at NYUAD You know I dont judge people Well I just judged her really hard but apart from that I dont judge people
There are so many freshmen walking about with hickeys ah young love Good times

Welcome to your first Thursday night class of 2022

Res Ed is so bad at their job theyre worse than the Egyptian Government
I have to confess that of all the places in time and around the world I could be right now this moment at NYUAD is better than average
rom admin Welcome back to campus guys
The intensity of the facebook discussions and the passiveaggressiveness between students is concerning for someone coming back to campus in a week We are the most diverse student body in the world Do you expect that we would agree on everything When arguing with someone please consider their religious cultural ethnic background and More personal experience See where other people are coming from Do not lose others because you disagree on some social issues This is a university a place for a free flow of ideas not an indoctrination camp where only one way of thought is dominant
Whats with alums being so involved in oncampus debates We appreciate the occasional word of advice but shouldnt you have something better to do with your time than baitinstigate If this is what life after NYUAD looks like then Im concerned
The greatest curse of being a global leader is finding the perfect fellowshipinternshipjob that fits your dreams and qualifications only to realize the position is only open to American citizens
Lol ResEd just outdoes their own stupidity every time Im no hard core sustainability advocate but who in their right mind throws away hangers that are in perfect condition just to stick to their socalled policies Ive never seen a more inefficient department and I come from a developing country That says something

This page is one of the top results when I search on Facebook NYUAD Im in my last year of senior school and I dont want to apply here any more if it is like you say it is
Ive seen a lot of people talk about feeling alone and depressed on campus and just needing someone to talk to I know this isnt the most conventional way to do this but at least it would be somewhere for people to see 
Comment if it is okay for anyone to message you even if they dont know you orand regardless of their relationship More with you if they feel like they need someone to talk to 
Please only do so if you are absolutely sincere and really willing to do so I t is also absolutely okay not to feel like you can Lets spread some love 
Some of the upperclassmen that I have spoken to have been really fake when it comes to helping out They comment on my ROR posts willing to help but when I PM them they ignore my messages or give me halfassedinaccurate information They only comment because they want their peers to see and think theyre kind and helpful but deep down there is so much ugly competitiveness arrogance and snobbiness Thank you to the upperclassmen who are genuine when it comes to offering help you know who you are
When I read some confessions which fall more under the category of rantargument I wish there were a way for a confession to be reviewed by copy editors They are just structured and written like trash While some believe that people should move from the veil of anonymity ie confessions to more formal mediums for the sake of openness and transparency I think we should do so so that peoples ideas and arguments are structured and coherent
I dont want to go back I dont want to walk the same highline as someone who I know to be a sexual harasser as someone who I know to be a sexual assaulter etc I agree I am not the victim but I would lie if I said I dont shake a little when I see them How long are these people gonna be covered for
Do people get offended when people wear clothing that isnt from their culture Or soccer jerseys from countries other than their own In a manner that is out of love and respect not out of a desire to mock the culturecountry Heart react Im fine with it I dont get offended as long as the person is not mocking the place Angry react I think people should only wear clothing that belongs to their culture and soccer jerseys from their country
Ive read an older article about the disappoint level students experience after they graduate from NYUAD I know the situation has improved with lots of students getting into really good grad schools and some getting good jobs Nowadays entering the industry is very competitive in addition to the fact that many students from our school More apply for the same jobs as the rare number of entrylevel jobs available out there I might be mistaken for this sentence and fact but its what Ive observed in the past 23 years Im a rising senior and have researched potential jobs though a lot of them ask for 23 years of experience how do we get that experience when we can do limited More
Im an incoming freshman and I dont think Ill make any friends at nyuad Whenever I talk on the group chat people ignore me or reply quite rudely I dont think anyone shares the same interests as me and no one in my class has really made an effort to reply to me I got bullied really badly in high school and I guess the cycle of me being the outsider is going to repeat itself My anxiety has worsened because of this and I dont know how Im going to cope once I arrive on campus
Being a student from the US the biggest reason Im excited to get back to campus is that I dont have to worry about making akward eye contact through the gaps in bathroom stalls
Lets face it Despite NYUADs diversity there is some intense selfsegregation that occurs in this school Races barely mix often to a stark and dismal extent And everyone hides under their excuse of we need to seek some familiarity in a place that is so different from our homes Global leaders this is not the school we signed up for More But that is sadly a reality that colors or doesnt for the white kids who stay with their white counterparts although in no way do I want to shame them the colored individuals are just as bad if not miles worse the university

Lol at politically conservative kids acting like the school is a intolerant and dangerous place for them to express views claiming time and time again this unistudent body has proven that only certain views are tolerated What incidents have there actually been Like the whole post anonymously on confession about representation is necessary because the student body is oh so harmful Just sounds like hiding behind the fear of not being able to argue your case well enough
firstworldproblems NYUAD edition Being upset that your country is 3 hours away because your friends who live far away earn more air miles
I came from a place where I had nothing Earning money for food was challenging and I would sleep to fight my hunger I worked hard got the grades and made it to nyuad and I am so grateful Im grateful to the UAE and its rulers for giving me a better life Now I am guaranteed a meal on my plate The lack of financial burden has made it More easier for my family to live and I am educating myself in the process This is the most generous place in the world with the kindest local and expatriate community I am happy to be here and I remind myself of that everyday This is why I hate seeing negative stereotypes about Arabs in the media and Emiratis in patricular on this group because they are nothing but biased and untrue I love everything about the NYUAD and the UAE and it is an honor to be living here
This is not a post about mental health and WHERE to find help This is a post raising a question HOW one should go about getting help feeling safe and comfortable Ive been struggling emotionally for the last few years The case intensified once I moved to university with the additional weight of academic stress isolation and lack More personal space to be openly sad while sharing a double on Saadiyat bubble NYUAD offers plenty of resources for emotional wellbeing that I am aware of and thankful for I am slowly working on myself 💪🏻 but sometimes I still need to talk it out you know However due to the very deep personal nature of my issues I simply do not feel comfortable More
I see you guys prying on freshman girls Adding people on Facebook and all How bout you get to know them first
Im so nervous about the marhaba math placement test Its making me feel so depressed because my major depends on a high placement
Dear freshmen and nonfreshmen As you venture throughout your studies at NYUAD you will most likely intensify your frequency and maybe even depth of interactions with fellow humans to a level unprecedented by your earlier life stages Be openminded and let people in It will be wonderful Also know that here the walls of privacy are thin More and bumping into visible reminders of lost opportunities hurt and heartbreak occur at a throbbing rate on these small patches of Island home As you attach and detach from people I hope for the sake of your sanity you remember the following A person who values you would not put themselves in a position to lose you If they do and you have the More
I really dont know what to do Im an incoming freshmen and our rooming assignments leaked for a few minutes and I found out that I was put in the same room as my high school bully They made my high school experience hell and Im so scared to be sharing a room with them Can anyone help me please
Im so tired of people associating a specific age with a class Freshmen can be within the age range of 1620 years old and Seniors can be around 2024 years old give or take Not all freshmen are underage minors Idk just something to think about
What counts as sexual harassment at nyuad dont give me the anything the victim felt uncomfortable with bullcrap shouldnt one have some standards before labeling someone a harasser and dont give me the toxic masculinity bullshit I identify as sheher
If the admins for Confessions and CC have an anonymous gorilla suit wrestling match Id pay a semesters worth of dining dirhams to go see that
Suddenly I remembered that my sexual harasser is going to be back on campus in the fall Suddenly I am not so excited about going back to school I was excited about the classes Im taking and seeing my friends but now Im just discouraged and dont know what to do PS I did report the incident
Theres really no need for everything to be constructively criticized on the forum sometimes you want to say something and not deal with the selfrighteous prickstheres nothing wrong with that and thats plainly the whole point of confessions
As a recent graduate seeing Tristans face on nyuadmarhabas story made me utterly happy and sadnyuad really is a special place ❤️
omg can we all stop with these underrepresentation posts listen i dont think admissions are sitting in their office and hand picking candidates and be like nah i dont like these African Americans were not taking them im pretty sure theres a reasoooonnnn just for every person that doesnt get into our uni from any other More country like grades or volunteering or whatever yall be fighting later that admissions are trying to diversify the campus and send offers to everyone but those who actually have worked super hard to get here also dont forget that our uni is also not the most popular in the world and people still have stereotypes about the Middle East when they think More
The reason why many people opt to post anonymously is simply because they have a confession that they think is worth bringing up but do not wish to deal with the aftermath Maybe their too busy to follow up or they dont want to deal with the negative criticism because they know that they might get stigmatised negatively in such a small More community Which brings me to my main point on why I sincerely despise individuals who comment on confessions being all high and mighty and politically correct Just get off your high horse and stop commenting because you think the comment will get you tons of likes since youre being politically correct Also man up when you made a mistake either More
Disclaimer I am not the author of the article referred to in 3254 As a member of another minority group that often gets shunned because we too are deemed sensationalist and selfindulgent when trying to highlight issues pertinent to our community this confession hits hard This is exactly why generally I refuse to speak about issues my More community systemically face unless Im either conversing with people who have similar experiences or people who are willing to listen rather than suggest my narrative lacks truth as soon as a part of it appears unsubstantial in this case whether he truly is first or not I want to applaud the author for his courage of stepping outside his More
Im sick of all these people expressing opinions regarding campus topics and issues through confessions Post on forum at least there we can all have meaningful debates and conversations Otherwise use this time to do something more productive over summer including to take a break
Friends and classmates Im genuinely baffled by the recent criticism of the Gazelle article on African American representation I understand that there was disagreement on the definition of African American however the author clarified his interpretation to be those descended from slaves and explained why it is an important distinction More Furthermore even if you do not consider the author the first African American male his point that there is a lack of representation remains valid especially given the large number of Americans admitted every year Our resistance to acknowledging the issue he brings up is almost as worrisome as the issue itself
Totally a fan of constructive criticism but like isnt this whole attacking The Gazelle thing a bit random They try their best to represent the voice and opinions of the student body it doesnt mean everything they publish is objectively correct The article being criticized is just ONE opinion among others Sincerely not a gazelle member
As an incoming freshman Im struggling with parental resistance to my inevitable departure Right now Im struggling to convince them that Ive made the right the decision that the opportunity Ive been afforded isnt particularly worthwhile or noteworthy that the education wont live up to the standards in my own country that my More prospects of getting jobs have been limited because of NYUADs lack of prestige and its relative newness I have my own objections to these points but my parents believe that I am blinded by novelty of it all Did anyone else face similar problems after they were accepted How did you deal with it
The gazelle article was dumb The inaugural class had 141 students who started college in 2010 Many races and nationalities were underrepresented because the old NYUAD campus was small and it was the universitys first year However NYUAD gave us a bigger campus and I am seeing greater representation so admissions are considering More representation significantly This school is one of the most diverse schools I have ever seen There are a variety of nationalities and ethnicities represented as opposed to only a few nationalities that dominate the student body Think about it this school couldve been exclusive to UAE high school students but they opened up their arms to all different types of people around the world Think about how the majority of universities in the US have less than 15 and LESS international students and these are old wellestablished institutions Think about how those institutions charge their international students double and fail to offer financial aid
The article made me genuinely curious how many african americans are on campus likecomment if you are 
LMFAO Crushes and Compliments refused to post my comment which points out that they take some posts down after a few hrsdays CrushesCompliments I like but I see what youre doing Lol
I recently got out of a conversation with my friends from back home about dorms I had literally nothing to say while they complained about how expensive dorms are or how hard they have to work to earn hall points to get housing the next year None of my friends have resources as good as the ones we get at NYUAD Ffs Our bathrooms are More comparable to a five star hotels bathroom 
So while this is not really a confession I think this is the opportune time with freshman less than a month away older kids missing NYUAD and sick of home and the marhabawelcome crew getting ready to head back to just put it out there that maybe we can start showing appreciation for NYUAD in smaller More
The First Black American Male Student at NYUAD enrolled as part of the Inaugural Class in 2010 and graduated in 2014 So did the first Black American Female Student This is in contradiction to the Gazelle article criticising the institution for admitting its first Black American male in 2017 Addressing race and accessibility is important More and there is an abundance of real accurate data to support effective action Sensationalism and selfindulgent comparisons to genuine civil rights leaders dont help the community Its not for the culture People need to know the truth to do the right thing and the school paper needs to fact check
I CANNOT get over how gorgeous Sheikh Hamdan is I follow him on instagram and each time he puts on another story I literally gasp And on top of physical perfection he is so kind and humble and generous Can we petition to have him as the commencement speaker please

After spending some years at NYUAD Ive come to understand what it is about this place and being here that often drives us crazy I have lost count of the number of times Ive heard people say that coming here has been great but theyve actually become less confident than what they used to be in high school After interacting with many More many people and having the deepest of introspections I have come to realize the following You cant be everything You can and should play another octave but you cant play every octave Find one or two things you like and enjoy doing and use the universitys resources to become better at it I know that people who are highly regarded here More

To the dear cutie that left a mint gum stuck to the bottom of a desk at E this Monday evening
My gratitude to you is ineffable You know before you happened to me I used to think that I was staggering from all the shit that fell on my shoulders How wrong I was Your frivolity with the gum took the wool off my eyes unveiling how More much free time I indeed have to go around campus in attempts to find a cleaning service just to finally hear that the fabric my pants were made from cannot be dry cleaned I used to think that the amount of my problems has reached the apogee apparently I still have some extra stress space left Now my pants with a sticky gum do not just symbolize my despair and distress they also act as an eternal idol of our newborn relationship You might think this was a sarcasm nay thingy vailed contempt but I will be honest this gum will firmly hold our mutual love till the very moment I find you and stick it into your throat in hopes of seeing you suffocating

NYUAD has the most number of whineyass students crying mental health problems at the smallest inconvenience Yeah college is hard classes are hard and youre never going to be the allrounder you were in high school Suck it up and deal with it Youre not depressed youre making yourself a victim Stop being such hypochondriac wusses and deal with life 
Typical NYUAD students 
A very Happy Holidays reminder that your break just started but its gonna end soon too 
I hate myself every now and then I take a vow to not eat KFC till but I keep failing What should I do I am a disciplined person in the academics but not KFC 
Still thinking of PhD after graduation 
honestly I just want to express how grateful I am for this man without him I would not be able to be so fortunate to go here bc no matter how you feel about nyuad you cannot deny how easy we have some stuff 
This is an appreciation post for all guy friends who dont want to hook up with their female friends You are great friends and Im sure that extends beyond your ability to befriend a gender you are attracted to and not proclaim your love to them Sometimes it takes someone telling you to leave your so for them because they love you More and were always there for you you know like a good friend for you to sit down and think about how grateful you are that not all of your guy friends want to sleep with you even though this asshole made you feel like that for a little while
Thanks to everyone who respects people Just in general Human decency 
I wish people wanted me as much as they want luggage scales and vacuum cleaners at the end of every semester 
To upperclassmen how do you deal with the winter break goodbyes especially to those you wont see until senior year 
it has only been one day but i already miss campus and the people who were there so very much i know we signed up knowing friends will be leaving all the time when we came here but i am really struggling anyway knowing that so many people who are the reason i love nyuad will be gone 
It might take a year It might take a day But whats meant to be will always find its way 
Ladies if he gets hard at inconvenient times makes you cry at least once a week keeps you from succeeding at your life plans constantly fucks you over Thats not your man Thats FoS 
I wish I could reenact scenes from shades of grey Like the one that she got the job right out of college 
just want to appreciate everyone who isnt ecstatic about going home for winter break maybe its an unsupportive toxic or bigoted family or maybe you feel safer or more provided for and comfortable on campus I see you and appreciate you and hope this break goes so much better than you could ever hope for💗 
Yuki Chiu is the most wholesome person on this campus She is a living ball of sunshine and her hugs are only rivaled in warmth by her smile Shes amazing and Im honored to be her friend even though she can be a little immature sometimes 
Gotta love hypocrisy of parents

nyuad students are really obsessed with campus cats 
Life in NYUAD seems so temporary sometimes you know what I mean right people study away have internships and we all have new things springing up as the years continue to go by which is a good thing but its sad at the same time To everyone please take the time to appreciate the gems around you that continue make your NYUAD experience worth it Tag those gems 
Its disappointing to fall for someone who doesnt fall for you But its a whole other feeling of hurt when youre halfway with someone and realsie it If you dont want to be with someone why dont you just let them know I hear so many of my friends especially male friends convince themselves they didnt reallyyyyy do something wrong More or didnt reallyyyyy lead someone on all because the two involved werent an official Facebook couple after all I mean who even does these Facebook updates anymore
Seriously what happened to human decency Im not talking about hookup situations where both people know or have commucated clearly whats going on But if youre seeing someone especially repeatedly you know they feel it more than you you know you have no intention of anything honestly how can you not take your position as the less emotionally attatched to show this person mercy and let them go Is it difficult to offer them that kindness Is it that easy to be lazy with other peoples emotional wellbeing all because youre unsure or because to you its not that deep 
academic integrity is key
To Koki You are an amazing inspiration and are cute and hot the same time Thanks for sharing your life with me and thanks for being so honest There are so many people that are way too insecure to admit that they have concerns but not you You are down to earth and approachable you just made my day You dont have to look to other people for answers you are amazing in your own way

Every day is a good day to express how much we appreciate all the contract staff in the dining hall library cafe convenience store and everywhere else on campus but ESPECIALLY these days when theyre spending extra hours working late to take care of us so we can do finals So take an extra minute to thank them We would really not be able to succeed without them but they rarely get the thanks they deserve Lets remember to let them know we see them care for them and appreciate them 💗

Shout out to all the stuff in library convenient store and library cafe that stay late with us during finals Honestly people should appreciate their work when we get late night snacks and research help after their usual working hours❤️❤️

Seniors dont ever let anyone tell you that you dont have time anymore and that you should make up your mind as to what you want to do postgraduation Life does not surround about that moment of postgraduation it is so much more Take your time take your time to figure out what you want to do how you want to get there and most importantly who you want to be

Everyone cant wait for the semester to be over but Im not really excited about winter break Its not that I dont really want to spend time back at home but I just love it here Im not looking forward to leaving even if its for a few weeks Especially since so many of my friends are going to be gone when I come back and I wont see More them for a year Even though we have issues sometimes I cant imagine this place without them
In these last few days please appreciate where you are and the people around you I know we all have finals but make time to spend with your friends and make memories grades arent everything Live in the moment instead of constantly thinking of the moment youll get out of here Go to events celebrate holidays you have no business celebrating go out once with your friends take a break or two Stop procrastination do the work you need to get done everyday and then enjoy yourself everyday You can do it

I am driven by H A T E

When I was in the first grade I discovered the great pleasure of what happens if u start humping a chair and would do it in class aLL the tIME even got my friends into it too I kept doing it until I got called into the principles office told not to cave into the devils desires 
this is the story of how I dragged my parents out of work so they can hear from the prince Ive been masturbating in class
In light of recent events I have really started to reflect on my own mental health I had been so deeply unsure and unhappy with myself for a while and the only thing that made the days pass was by filling it with tons of social events and constantly being with people Anyone who knows me would probably say that I am constantly positive More and upbeat but I am just feeding off their energy When I am alone I start to get anxious depressed and cant get anything done I really urge anyone feeling the same way to reach out for professional help it really has helped Your feelings are valid and you matter
Back in 2013 I got into CSTEP and NYU fresh out of high school My high school counselor was the only person I had in regards to helping me with my FAFSA college apps etc She told me I had 1 extra day to fill out my papers and submit my financial aid documents I trusted her and submitted the day she told me I got a letter from NYU More saying I was getting no financial aid and the scholarship I had received wouldnt even cover 13 of the tuition Im poor My parents had offered to take out a loan for me to go to my dream school I couldnt let them do that so I applied to marymount manhattan got in and started my new college path I hated it I ended up dropping out I started working started my own consulting firm and last semester started at a community college 
Im now a 40 student and just got into NYU and Columbia with a full ride
I used to have these terrible scars on my knees and arms that prevented me from wearing the clothes that I wanted After rejection from many surgeons I finally got an appointment with an esthetician who was able to FULLY treat the scars I was inspired to do many things like lose weight join clubs and become an esthetician myself who More helped people I just wanted to let you guys out there know that if you struggle to know what u want to be in life become what helped you because now I can wear dresses and be the sexy girl I know I am
I just realized that now that Ive introduced my friends to NYU Secrets I cant ever bitch about them there
Ive been personally affected by the college admissions cheating scandal and dont what to do In a few days my father may turn up on the list but Im not sure None of my friends know but if they follow the news and connect the dots the jig will be up for me
I just shoplifted from the NYU bookstore Between paying for my housing tuition and daily expenses I cant afford or justify paying almost 100 for a book I tried to borrow a friends buy used or find an online copy but because its a workbook with problem sets and a unique online access code for each book I need to have my own new copy and I couldnt think of any other options
Hey readers
Last week we were considering posting 5 rejected secrets weekly and put it to a vote Out of almost 800 votes 68 chose Yes so we present you the first Miscellaneous Sunday let us know if you have any better names
We have a general guideline for why we reject posts but oftentimes for edge cases the line will be hazy We wont More specify what motivated us to reject our Miscellaneous Sunday secrets so here they are straight from the inbox
I wank it in Bobst private bathrooms

I know this is mean but I absolutely loathe fat people Its involuntary because its not hatred but more like uncontrollable disgust I have tried to not More
Ive been seeing this girl for the past year and weve been having unprotected sex almost every day shes on birth control When it started I told her I had just gotten tested and she said she trusts me so doesnt need me to show her proof When I asked about her she said she hasnt gotten tested but hasnt done anything that would put More her in danger and that I can trust her We were talking the other day and she jokes that her mom bought her a box of condoms 2 years ago and she hasnt finished them yet 
 I know she had 2 fuck buddies the year before me so I ask her about using condoms with them After trying to change the subject she finally admits that she wasnt really that More
The Tisch Drama studio system is wild I have collected data for the rest of you so if you meet a Drama kid I can help you figure out if theyre chill or not chill
Stella Adler Pretty chill Have a lot of black clothes Theyre usually actually very normal Some have a superiority complex but its not that bad 
Meisner Hit or miss More Either selfconscious as fuck or coked out of their minds Theres a few solid ones in there but it changes day by day

Gonzalo one of the guys who swipes you into Downstein is the best staff member at NYU and you cant change my mind Hes literally the reason I still have a meal plan even though hed probably let me in for free if I asked 
To everyone who keeps shitting on other majors they dont deem worthwhile Grow the fuck up If you seriously believe a major is only worthwhile because it leads to a clear job market then youd be better off at a trade school The point of obtaining a degree from a university like NYU isnt to learn a trade its to develop skills that More can be applicable to any kind of job
I graduated with a physics degree because I love science and I think its important But I didnt get it to go off and exclusively do physics research or teach I stuck with physics because it gave me the opportunity to learn how to problem solve 
I also have a minor in English because I love to read and More
Fuck this school and its shitty financial aid services You think that when your parents make borderline 20k combined you wouldnt have to pay 60k in tuition This was the only school I ever showed demonstrated interest for and it was my dream to attend this school Unfortunately I got accepted in 2017 and my parents could not afford me More to go here and ever since I questioned the integrity of NYUs financial aid dept Im only one of many classmates who were in the same boat Thank god that I received an offer from a top 10 school with better financial aid but I would have loved to go here and stay closer to home
Real tea is knowing NYU doesnt wash their rice Sad reaccs only please
Holy fuck I hate cleaning up after my fucking roommate Once he left a fatass ice creamass shit in the toilet and I couldnt flush it down I had to get some scissors reach in and cut that shit apart just so it would flush What kind of fuckshit is that As a gay man in the United States of America I deserve better I hope youre happy you sick fuck Shiii
i used to have a stuffed animal stitch like from lilo and stitch in my bedroom my old suitemate moved out and we got a new one the second the old one left and the new one came the stitch went missing i ransacked my entire room looking for this plush and he was NO WHERE TO BE FOUND my hunch is one of them stole it everytime i see my More old suitemate around campus i immediately think to myself i know you fucking did it its been almost a month and i have no concrete evidence to accuse either of the two i just want my son back bringbackstitch
I always thought I would lose my virginity by the end of college But with two months left its not looking great Im not saving myself or anything and I know I could just go get with someone if I really wanted to But there is still this part of me that feel like its worth it to wait to feel comfortable To feel safe I dont have to be in love But I wanna look back and remember feeling like it was with someone I trusted Idk But Im also getting mad horny so only time will tell I guess 
Most people here have probably heard of the Baby shark song I recently did too Ever since then I cant stop singing the song walking down the street standing in the elevator and even doing my homework Am I the only one experiencing the baby shark symptom But meanwhile baby shark doo doo doo doo doo baby shark IT IS JUST SO DAMN CATCHY PLEASE SEND HELP 
The USC scandal is also applicable to medical schools I know a dude at Mt Sinai who is getting preferentialguaranteed residency placement at a competitive specialty just because his dad knows a department head The rich just dangle credentials and awards in front of us commoners to encourage us to work harder This is part of why I never wanted to pursue a PhD or become a professor 
To everyone who complains about how messy their roommatessuitemates are Do you have any idea how awkward it is when someones MOTHER is staying with you True its nice to have someone clean a space that guys will never clean but we really dont want the morality police over either
Going to the Resource Center in my dorm multiple times and asking for random things just to see the cute guy working at the desk I am obsessed lol
I have a Tuesday class right by the Brooklyn Bagel on 8th St and this really cute guy works there I was gonna ask him for his number this week but he wasnt there Ugh is it bad that my everything package includes him bring everything bagels Ugh now Im gone for break and hes gonna forget who I am
So I used to date this British guy at NYU but all he cared about was soccer so much so that he never he would put on his favorite team while we were getting intimate He would also make me go watch games with him at 8 am and looking back idk why I put up with it but he was so good at going down on me that it was worth it and now Im kinda a huge soccer fan worthit
Since PhiDE is here lets not forget the bullying that goes on within the frat of new ex and rejected members their ignoring of a sexual assaulter until someone finally spoke out and forced them to take action and their harm to the premed community by sharing previous exams as well as unauthorized material Someone needs to either report or investigate them on a deeper level because theyre so sketch
When people irritate me I sign them up for clubs at Club Fest if I want to severely annoy them they get Washington Square News sign up and I send documents with their net ID to the printer that will waste away their printer money if they hit print New form of being too passive to be passive aggressive 
Im absolutely disgusted that two NYU students would disrupt a vigil in honor of the Christchurch victims in order to harass Chelsea Clinton 49 people died and yet all you care about is yelling at a pregnant woman for clout You are not activists you are bullies and no one will ever take anything you say about islamophobia seriously More ever again 
ADMINS NOTE Reminder that when we do or dont post anything we dont do it because we either condemn or support the views which are expressed in the post Weve been debating for a while whether to publish any secrets which were relevant to the events which occurred Friday night and decided to publish one out of the many which we had received As the students are not directly mentioned we feel that ultimately this secret is fair to publish
In the same way the media after 911 popularized Osama Bin Laden and made him a household name synonymous with evil the media must do the same with David Duke Andrew Anglin and others Make it so that they are so well known that they cannot walk around the streets of this country safely
So I was walking back to my dorm in Carlyle I normally like to walk through Union Square Park and I pass by this couple sitting on a bench The girl was sitting on top the guys lap and it looked like his head was in her jacket Then I noticed his pants were kind of low and she was kind of like gyrating on top of him Thats when I realized I was watching two people have sex in public At least they seemed to be enjoying themselves This is something that I cannot unsee
Were considering a day each week in which we publish 5 secrets in one post which we had previously rejected This would consist of either incredibly tired topics Im sure our audience has some examples in More mind or stories which we consider obvious bait
However we understand students possibly feeling belittled because it may be for them the secret is far more important in impact than it may be to us mere reporters
So wed like to ask you all would you be interested in such a post
Im friends with the guy who posted 10702 and was there when we walked in on his room mate Was it wrong that I got hard and wanted to join him
After a long time coming I have realized that I really do need to get help I need to ask Is the Wellness Center any help Is it good at all
Palladium is wild The layout of the dorm is just a disaster in the making with the windows facing each other So far Ive seen multiple bongs being lit up casual nudity sex etc shoutout to the people who are confident enough to roam around shirtless even though they know someone is watching You know who you are 
My friend a girl is constantly complaining about relationship issues Guys being assholes or immature Heres the thing though theres a new fucking problem every week On several occasions Ive gotten fed up and stopped responding to her texts because the answer is so obvious to me SHES THE PROBLEM Maybe if you werent so obsessed with finding a boyfriend and so clingy all the time you would actually find a decent relationship But how do you tell a drama queen that shes an utter mess
Not really a secret but the admin clearly chooses the shit they post cuz Ive put some straight up shit and its never gotten posted 
Admins Note Trust me in a lot of ways its better that way
all of these basictier CAS stem majors are complaining about get a real major when theyre in NYU for a program that would have been 10x better at a school that they didnt have the grades to get into cough cough columbia 
before sternies rise up i get that you have to like sacrifice a goddamn baby lamb weekly for your public speaking courses but eventual world domination via means of corrupt capitalist business practices via south malaysianamerican international labor relations also isnt a real major 
as per 10709 In a bigger sense NYUs treatment of its low income students is actually pretty terrible across the board As an institution and like culturally Im here on a scholarship with borderline ridiculous stipulations My FAFSA gets selected for review every single year Since I moved off campus because I could no longer More afford to live in a dorm the Bursar regularly forgets to disburse my loan refunds Departmental pushes for students to take unpaid internships and join clubs and volunteer and scorn students with less full resumes who need to work or give themselves more time for school work or studying or family responsibilities is alienating af And you rich More
can people stop shitting on Gallatin A lot of people in Gallatin are getting degrees structured similarly to those in CAS It feels shitty reading the constantly repeated joke that were wasting money on our school I usually have a sense of humor but the joke is overused and starting to stick in a lot of other students minds that everyone in Gallatin is studying basket weaving Get a new joke Stop calling us stupid
Clarification on the hiring wealthy students for RAs thing the email that places people on the alternate list literally tells you that you have all the qualifications to be an RA which is why it doesnt make sense that they couldnt then take financial status into the equation when there is a pool of equally qualified applicants ¯ツ¯
Why does NYU housing keep placing with cringeworthy af koreaboos I might be Asian but Im not Korean though these koreaboos are so cringeworthy Im sure even Koreans would find them pathetic Now I really feel the need to specifically state that I am not Korean on my housing application No way in hell am I gonna get stuck with a new koreaboo every year 
Forget the security guard at Lafayette the security guard at Bobst with the beard tho
I have a good mate Hes one of the best ones if not the best in my life From the beginning of our friendship hes the one being kind to me and helping me out He opens my eyes However I am the one who always lets him down and drags him behind I feel bad and guilty Hes intelligent and creative He deserves a mate better than I am L always told him that I was sorry but theres nothing else I can do 
As a freshman in Stern you already know we get randomly assigned room mates I got two one also from stern and one from Tsich The dude from Tsich is such an ass and throws shade at us just because we were accepted into the business school One time he kicked both of us out because he was painting a nude portrait or some shit I was locked out for 6 hours
Im in like all of your classes There literally is no other reason were not dating other than I am being too much of a pussy to ask you out We are best friends but all I can ever do is think about how much better it would be if we were together Highlight of college is when we got drunk and kissed You know who you are 
The sax guy in the park is cool for about a week until youre trying to study in Bobst and youve heard his shitty rendition of Summertime for the 1000th time
My suitemate has had a guest living in our suite for the past week which normally I wouldnt care about but get this This girl has highkey been moving in to our bathroom and whatever Im only now tight because I went to go pee in the bathroom last night and my suitemate and her friends were giving this girl a haircut in the bathroom They left the entire floor shower and part of the toilet seat covered in hair Im livid and disgusted Its been about half a day since I witnessed this AND THERE IS STILL HAIR ALL OVER THE PLACE 
Speaking of this college admissions scandal I work in the Chemistry department and everyone knows about this one Premedicine student who got her organic chem grade bumped because her highlyconnected father made a special phone call to the professor get this nothing is gunna happen to her though because her dad is bffs with Andy Hamilton Tea 
Im one of the student staff at Bobst Stop leaving your beer cans in betweenbehind books on the shelves Please Unless theyre unopened
Last week I went with a friend of mine to the restaurant It was after my another unpleasant experience with one of the deans who is the only person in school who blocks my accommodations Guess what After we picked the table it turned out that this dean was sitting next to me and discretely waved to me with a little evil smile Then More the dean started talking to the people with whom they were sitting about all of the conversations and unpleasant experiences I had with the dean Since the dean knew I was under a huge preasure dean probably just wanted me to blow and start yelling Oh well I did not do this Best part this dean had a FAKE Louis Vuitton bag and it was this badly done that everyone could see this at the first glance
If you even breathe too loudly in 8N Im going to be the one to tell you to shut up And I wont even feel bad about it 
I live in 80 Laf Am I the only that do a Naruto run down the hall way when no one is around Oh well most of you here probably cant relate
I miss Yoel sosad
Ive masterbatted to a picture of my roommate about six times at this point I just want to fuck him but I dont think he knows Im gay
i really tried getting along w my roommate but she just does things that drive me up the wall i was eating my lunch and she walks in sniffs the room loud as fuck and is like are you eating something and im like yeah and she fucking says oh okay i thought it smelled bad in what fucking world is that shit okay to tell More anyone but she leaves her crusty ass socks all over the fucking room and stinks the place up and thats fine i hope you read this dirty ass bitch how many fucking times do i have to tell you to clean ya fucking socks 
The security guard at Lafayette is really hot 
Everything in my life is going great on paper but in the process of bolstering my resume Ive adopted a workaholic lifestyle and as a result am incredibly lonely I lie in bed every night wondering why I put myself through this stress and exhaustion when I have nothing to show for it emotionally Im no happier than I was before and More none of my friends can empathize with what Im going through Ive tried to explain it I guess Im posting this as a cry for support Im not going to hurt myself or anything like that but I would appreciate kind words 
Writing this because I need to hear this and hopefully this is for anyone else out there who feels the same way Ive struggled for years with depression and anxiety and it doesnt really leave New York is exciting but also incredibly challenging and our student community feels it while the administration puts out a letter or puts up More plexiglass without addressing the stress workload and anxieties the student community deals with Since I havent found the Wellness Exchange or NYUs multiple communities personally helpful Im reaching out to say that Ive often been saved by the kindness of strangers so Im sending out good vibes love support and strength to anyone whos reading this and needs this You are enough you are worthy you are cherished you are here I hope you are able to find support comfort care and all the things you deserve and that we can all be kind to each other and to ourselves 
Can we talk about the fact that in some cases NYU chooses to hire wealthy students for the RA position rather than students who desperately need the free meals and housing to avoid taking out huge student loans I get that its a job and the most qualified applicants are hired but I think its so fucked that theyll tell me Im good enough to be placed on the alternate list and then will go and hire people who really do not need the aid 
Submitted in Two Parts You ever just casually find out someone you have class with has an Extremely Questionable Problematic Fetish by accident You ever have it happen twice I feel like two people with the same Horrific Sexual Indulgence is too many whyidontdateatnyu
Id like to add to the last submission about the fetishes were not talking about your average every day mainstream foot fetish furry BDSM pee play shit This is Advanced Darkness 
Am I the only one who finds it kind of ironic when all these kids majoring in things like gender studies and acting start making fun of the Stern kids for trying to actually make something of their lives
This isnt really a secret but I just wanted to ask if anyone else has noticed that both the trash and recycling bins at bobst are emptied into the same trash bin by custodians I would like to ask the custodians or their direct employer to stop neglecting separating trash and recycling because our environment is becoming meeker by the More second and any small positive change is still a positive change however Im not sure how effective it would be to actually go forward with this request especially because its not the custodians faults that trash and recycling items are often already mixed up in both bins Does anyone have thoughts to share about this issue
Say all you want about Tandon boys but that tall guy pounded me for like 25 minutes Tandon 1 Square 0
Im normally a person whos at Bobst late so I never usually believe the crazy Bobst stories posted but lo and behold it happened to me Im sitting in 6W around midnight working on my paper by myself headphones on I look like an absolute mess and I hear two guys walk in talking at FULL VOLUME I think theyre just picking up some More stuff because it doesnt seem like theyre gonna stay but one of them comes up to me And he seems nice at first He says excuse me this is a weird question but do you like whales Yeah I guess I dont want to be a whale hater Well would you want to humpback at my place All I could say was OH MY GOD and he walked away claiming he was making a YouTube video or something ps you were kinda cute and I normally sit in 6N
My roommate is a literal fucking joke 
My roommate is such a slob She never picks up after herself She leaves her dishes unclean Never takes out the trash or separates the recycling Never puts toilet paper back Always slams the door when shes leaving and entering the dorm And she leaves a tsunami in the bathroom and hair in the More drain when shes done showering She stayed in our room for JTerm and there was a dogs worth of her hair spread out all over the bathroom sink She was there for an entire month and it was like coming back to a filth battle zone 
And you want to know the most ironic part of all of this Shes our floors RA So I cant go and ask for mediation 
If my dorm wasnt so close and convenient to all my classes I would have said fuck you and left a long time ago 
God I fucking cant stand her 
 Children let this be a lesson If you want to be an RA apply for it If she can be one then so can you 
My roommate is an exchange student from a university in China and hes been super sweet with the exception that he occasionally masturbates when I am in the room Like he just puts on his air pods closes his eyes and then has a go at it under his blankets It makes me really uncomfortable and he even did it once while I had guests over More in my fucking room He does not care who is in the room hes like in his own world Like what the hell My friends say it could be a cultural thing I have no idea and dont want to assume but I feel awkward calling him out on it I will probably confront him eventually but this is messed up like I am not crazy am I
For the 2014 Violet Ball when the tickets were released there was a 10 ticket maximum that you could buy Only the website didnt have a drop down box where one would select 110 tickets Instead it had a text field where you could enter any amount I tried various amounts until I apparently had all of the remaining 850 tickets were in my shopping cart Me and my roommate kept doing this for a few hours and watched as people were freaking out on the FB event page that all the tickets were gone They fixed the issue the next day
Im still in love with my ex Sometimes I masturbate to a pictures of him so when I see him around my body forgets that hes dating someone else and immediately associates him with amazing orgasms 
Have you ever realized that saying I lost my phone is a perfect excuse for not handing in your homework because of Duo Wao 
The last time the trash in my common area was emptied was 8 days ago now by me The pile has now become unreasonable and continues to grow every time someone introduces a new trader joes bag that they can fill with trash rather than just emptying whats already there Ive decided that I am resigned to living in this pile of filth rather More than caving and emptying my roommates mountain of shit Its getting to the point where theres so much trash that its hard to open the door or enter the kitchen so hopefully theyll empty it soon and I can stop gagging every time I walk in through the front door
I work as a server and I make sure to be extra nice to NYU students because they leave their IDs on the back of their phones just so I feel justified to talk shit when they tip 2 dollars for a 40 dollar bill or leave without tipping
My roommate and I are fighting because he told me I dont have a real major and dont need to study He studies all the time and thought I was being too loud so I asked him why he doesnt just chill out and he got pissed Now were not talking and I feel like shit What should I do
I was asked recently Why is it that Universities are a collection of brilliant people but not examples of collective brilliance I am still grappling for an answer
Theres a guy Ive been seeing onoff since september and I am really really into him and I hope he doesnt realize it because I dont think he feels the same way or would be willing to commit the way I kind of want to commit to him But every time I tell myself Im not going to talk to him again hell hit me up and I dont know Its not that I drop everything to meet up with him its that I actually respond We saw each other the other day in public and now I cant stop thinking about him He has such a nice voice
So a lot of people accuse me of being emotionless Primarily because they have never seen me crying or being emotionally unstable even in some really messed up situations But they dont know that when alone I often cry watching moviesanime damn Clannad listening to songs writingreading stories I guess Im just too good at controlling myself In fact so good that my friends would never think of me when they read this secret
Bodybuilding ends up being an antisocial hobby at one point At some point I realized if I wanna dial in my physique and achieve what I can be I cant go out And its impossible to explain to your friends that you cant go out with them on Friday cause youd rather save those macros for carbs and fats rather than booze A lot of Channels More on instagram and youtube preach a flexible approach to bodybuilding where you can still go out even while cutting but unless you have freak genetics or the discipline to avoid dollar pizza when you are drunk its nearly fucking impossible I guess ill be a hermit till I hit 8
be honest everyone follows iffatnur for the hot asian girls
Im only writing this here cause theres no way Ill be able to talk about this situation to anyone in real life EVER This is outside of NYU fortunately but still pretty fucked up Started lessons with a music teacher back in 2015 We have great chemistry and I learn a lot from them I just saw them as a great teacher and mentor or More at least thats the way I saw our relationship until recently when we started performing together We spend a good amount of time together They have made a few jokes that would indicate they like me in a different way It made me see them differently as well I began having sexual dreams about them and lately theyve been frequent What really More
question What is the procedure for when you see one of your friends like your secrets but they dont know you wrote it
My best friend has tinder and is a slut with it She constantly goes from one guy to the next A few days ago I logged into her account started sexting with a guy and then decided to meet up with him I deleted the conversation so she will never see it Then I sat across the street from where we were supposed to meet and watched the guy More sit on a bench and wait for me Now he will think she blew him up I am so mad at her My best friend no longer has time for me as she only wants to fuck men all day long Maybe its my fault that Im so jealous But its unfair And I have the right to be jealous After all its one fuck versus ten years of friendship So I win 
I masturbate in the car park whilst looking at certain individuals who are walking by
As an international Asian it boggles my mind how Americans eat rice with forks and think thats completely OK Thats A stupidity You dont shovel snow with a pitch fork You can try but its going to take you 5 times longer
Im a dude and my body count is something Im ashamed of Whenever someone asks for it I make up a stupid number like 5 In reality Ive lost count of the actual number I think Im a sex addict because I get really depressed after not having sex for 3 days
I am a math and CS major and most of my classes are graded on a curve So in a sense every person in my classes is competing with everyone else I am uncomfortable to share your homework ideas with someone else when the homework is a 3040 percent of the grade owing to the fact that it could dampen my chances of an A In fact in my CS More classes any kind of collaboration on our code can land us in a shitload of trouble because it counts as Academic Dishonesty And without any kind of intellectual collaboration or even partial friendships my introverted self has no friends I am stuck in my own vicious cycle of my living with my feelings of insignificance and loneliness
NYU Where the richest kids in the world gather to extoll the virtues of socialism where freethinkers and liberals gather to shut dissenting voices out of the public discourse where champions of the working man and woman gather to gentrify the city and uproot working men and women Am I wrong
Stern is awesome and all but ugh internships and IB FML I just want to hit the beach 
 PS I dont understand the point of sipping pina coladas on the beach They arent even that good I prefer those rum smoothy thingies with strawberrybanana or mango
My suitemates have extremely loud sex with their boyfriends all the time They even had sex in the bathroom when I was eating cereal in the living room One couple usually do in the bedroom first while the other couple waiting in the living room before they start to switch Sometimes four of them stay in the same room No idea what they were doing I timed them every time and I am seriously thinking about making a chart called comparative boyfriends and give it to them on Valentines 
I needed to talk to my boyfriend about my depression and how bad its gotten recently This is something Ive been panicking over and dreading for weeks and I mentioned it to him when he called He kept pressuring me to tell him what I needed to say but I told him I preferred to do it in person This set him off and he assumed I was More pregnant He flipped a shit and I asked him what if I were pregnant He had the audacity to say that birth control isnt his responsibility and that I shouldve been more careful This is someone Ive been dating for over a year someone I thought I could trust with what Ive been going through and my depressionI was so wrong Hes not worth my time anymore if this is how he handles any situation THANK GOD Im not pregnant cause I would hate to have a child have him as a dad Now I just feel even more depressed and I dont know what to do
I just had someone tell me he just transferred at a club and didnt have many friends and I told him I didnt have many friends either coz Im just back from a leave of absence and he told me were in this together now
 When I asked for a number or Facebook or something at the end of the meeting he told me that he wasnt ready for that More level of friendship and told me we needed to work up to it But he doesnt plan on coming again
 I went to this club to try to make a friend with a common interest and I literally got ghosted in real life
 Why do I have to be so weird and annoying I fucking hate myself
 Im so lonely
Well I think Im the 10670s roommate And I wasnt sure if I actually saw that but now I am sure and I wanna die Thanks
I think I have one of the worst roommates at NYU Hes dirty but doesnt clean up after himself I would be okay with that if he didnt trek into my personal space and mess up my area He also has no manners whatsoever He watches his shows and roars with laughter literally almost every night EVEN DURING FINALS WEEK WHEN PEOPLE NEED TO More SLEEP AND STUDY I even wake up around 1 every night because he cant stop whistling and singing I cant make this shit up
 Recently the sanitation was so bad that I got sick Im embarassed to bring anyone over The only reason why I dont do anything about it is because I know hes got his own issues 
My RA is kind of hot but I think he blocked me on Grindr 
I often wonder if Im too nice but then I wonder if Im even nice enough Is it stupid to give everything you have for people who cant or wont appreciate it Is it worth it to love those who need it most meaning the ones that push you awayWish I knew
Why does every gay at NYU feel like theyre the shit Sweetie take a seat and lower your ego down to earth Stop acting like youre Beyoncé when youre really Michelle Williams
Has anyone else seen those posters saying that the Wellness Exchange is iMessage for mental health and felt attacked for resisting Apple 
 Android users of NYU UNITE You have nothing to lose but your green bubbles
I wear the hijab and I feel like no one wants to date me because they assume Im not open to a relationship But Im also ugly so that could be part of it lol
 Im a registered wedding officiant in New York and my best friends want me to marry them Except I have a major crush on one of them Ive literally had dreams about this person leaving my friend for me I dont want to marry them but if I dont do it then theyll know Why am I so thirsty that my subconscious would want me to sabotage true love Lets pray my years of acting experience get me through this 
 my roommate walked in on me sucking my own dick yesterday and we havent spoken since im so embarrassed i just want to disappear 
 I was really into this guy for a year and a half He was everything I wanted he was tall ambitious funny smart and rich Im not shallow I just know what I want We hung out a few times but hes in Florence this semester I dont know if Ill ever get to see him again and every day I wish Id just hopped on that dick and ridden it to Florence with him 
 Last year I met the most attractive boy through my friend and he HOT And the type of hot where he doesnt even know it I invited him to my dorm to hangout with my friends and I and we were really hitting it off Then my hoe ass roommate came in and wouldnt stop talking to him the rest of the night She knew I liked him and she was all over him and got onto the bed with him and was being all touchy and flirty I was so mad I tried to set his foot on fire 
 I broke up with my boyfriend of a year in December and then got with one of my friends a week later After break he friendzoned me but now Im going on a date with a new guy on Tuesday My roommates havent gotten any since last year and are all currently single and honestly pretty desperate I feel bad that Im on my third guy in three More months and theyre still pathetically making online dating accounts while I constantly tell them that they are beautiful and smart which they are But what ever if they want attention from guys they just need to try harder I mean they are all conventionally pretty but I guess thats not enough these days
Anthony who works at Sidestein is seriously the nicest dude ever Even making small conversation with him just makes my day Big ups to Anthony for real
I got really obviously hit on for my first time last spring at Peets Coffee in Kimmel I wish I had done something about it but I wasnt really sure until he left and gave me a note saying that I was pretty I was in a somewhat relationship with a guy at the time so I didnt try to find the guy but that relationship ended a week later and I realized I never really liked him anyways I feel bad that I ignored the cute guy who hit on me and I keep hoping Ill run into him again but I havent
How do you break up with someone whos suicidal and threatens to kill themself if you do but at the same time says youre the reason they want to kill themself I try reaching out to his closet friends but then get yelled at because somehow Im supposed to keep this all to myself Am I supposed to keep it to myself Or am I supposed to More tell people closest to him He tells me I dont care about him If only he knew the extremes I was going to in order to make sure he was okay He constantly tells me I dont care yet the things I do to try and help him are extremely evidentiary of me caring I feel like everything is falling apart The only thing thats ever on my mind is me worrying about him killing himself Its consuming my life and I cant focus on anything else I have tried every outlet and nothing seems to be working 
 How can one just sit around and listen to someone say they want to kill themself and not tell the people closest to that person about it How am I supposed to deal with something like this This makes me want to be single forever 
Response to 10644 Advice from an alum who is still with their high school sweetheart and did 4 years of successful crosscountry long distance If you want to make it work you can make it work and it can become one of the best choices you ever made 
 Yes most high school relationships dont work out But guess what Most college More relationships dont work out either We are at an age where its undeniably hard to have a healthy lasting relationship because were all trying to figure ourselves out simultaneously At this age long distance may be the best thing to ever happen to your relationshipgiving you the space to explore independently and have unconditional support More
One of my closest friends 4 years recently had life take a huge shit on him a couple months ago His girlfriend left him which triggered his depression right before finals which caused him to do really badly in his classes and he hasnt really recovered from either of those situations On top of that his family started having money More trouble recently so hes been asking me to float him a couple bucks every couple of days so he can buy food in bulk he doesnt spend it on other things Ive confirmed That being said given how long this has been going on hes a few hundred in debt to me and Im starting to get irritated with him because hes not really motivated to change More
To incoming freshmen staying with my high school sweetheart made me complacent when it came to my unsatisfaction with my freshman year I went to see him every other weekend and missed out on opportunities to spend more time with the friends I made on my floor and work on sets to meet more people in the film program My selfesteem was More low no matter how much I told myself I was happy because at least I had a boy who loved me and my body image was degrading After we broke up I was depressed for a month But then I downloaded Tinder and started going on dates rekindled my relationship with my sister started going to the gym spent wholesome time with my friends and got work More

All the girls always look for tall guys no matter what their height is but do guys look for tall girls Like is 510 intimidating because on a good day every girl I see compliments me but Im still not pulling Do guys like tall girls
I grew up in the Bible belt and while I was going through middle and high school I used to think that my neighbors were some of the most miserable mean spirited bastards to walk the planet or if they presented a good face that they carried such an attitude in their hearts
 After 7 semesters here I wouldve laughed in past mes face because he had no clue how utterly fucking wrong he was
I dont know how to convince my parents to be okay with my boyfriend We both are working both of us have good salaries But we both are of different religions It doesnt affect us but its a big deal to our families I dont want to force or threaten them I want them to understand and accept us both But doesnt look like its gonna happen Life sucks at the moment 
Im a Junior at Tandon and I am starting to realize that I have absolutely no friends Next year were gonna need to pair up into groups of 6 for our capstone project and I have literally no one to be with My freshman year I got involved with the wrong crowd and after things went south with them i completely excluded myself from all More social situations sophomore year Now I sit in the back of the classroom talk to no one and just meander through the semester Im scared that ill have no one for my senior design next year bc of how removed ive become What should I doooo Note Everyone in my major is really condescending so its hard to just go up and be friends with them
Its really sad how Asian girls dont get called hot or considered attractive without heavy makeup on I mean being cute doesnt necessarily make a girl desirable However that type of look is so deviant from how Asian females look barefaced without incredibly thicc eyelashes and eyeliner Its also sad how some Asian girls More overfetishize themselves in exchange for attractivenesspopularity im gonna put it this way here if you know you know Lets face it every time you talk about a hot Asian girl you arent referring to how she naturally looks like There are hot black white or hispanic girls out there with zero or light makeup though Im not saying that More
A girl I dated for two years was working on an erotic novel that I found out from a friend actually just got published I read a portion of it out of curiosity and theres this scene where a character whose penis is described extremely similarly to my own becomes a cuckold forced to witness some crazy shit with his pants down Im still processing how I feel about this
One of my best NYU memories so far is doing coke off a dumpster next to a church at 2 am Nothing will get you to do a great rally like cocaine
Merry Christmas
A guy Ive been dating told me recently that he purposefully exposed me to an untreatable STD I am paralyzed by fear to get tested and I am afraid that if I am positive I will never be able to find someone that will accept me and want to date or marry I feel like he ruined my life and I dont know what to do Im so ashamed
I was walking by astor place around midnight saturday when I see some random guy start punching a cars window The car hit the gas as hard as possible and sped away The guy punching the car tried to hold on and ended up on the floor He then got up stopping traffic and began to run He then approached some girl across the street and More straight up sucker punched her Three guys stepped in to help her but I just ran away as fast as possible Over my three years at nyu ive seen some weird shit but that had to be the most badshit crazy by far It was a scene out of a zombie movie 
Noticed this individual at Kaufman Management Center Stern who was opening his BRAND NEW American Express Platinum credit card Wooden box and all Thats probably the most Stern thing Ive witnessed while being at NYU
Even though I got through recruiting successfully I still think its the biggest scam ever
I still have a huge crush on this guy from my english class last year I havent seen him since the last day of class but I honestly felt like there was something there Do yall think its too late to reach out or would I just look like a stalker
My two best friends are dating and recently they had a pregnancy scare Theyre still together but she told me she would have kept it and they would have raised it together He told me he would have either expected an abortion or a breakup I dont know if I should tell them what the other one said I wont but damn does it make my life awkward
Ive been hooking up with this guy for a while and we started dating a few months ago About a week ago one of his friends told me he was evaluated by a psychologist and found out he was on the spectrum a long time ago He never told me this and I was shook but also felt like an idiot for not realizing it I looked at him completely More differently after and started paying attention to things like the way he awkwardly interacted with people that I never noticed before I cant hang out with him without constantly thinking about his condition I dont know how to bring it up with him without it being uncomfortable Does it make me a bad person if I were to break up with him because of this
I was in Duane Reade waiting on line The cashier was helping a tourist couple who thought they should tip him for his services Apparently Duane Reade employees arent allowed to accept money from customers He started saying no this isnt a place to tip and they didnt understand so they insisted left the money on the counter and More hurried out the door The guy started freaking out and looked to the camera behind the counter pointing to the money and shaking his head Then he waved his arms at the camera as though to say no and Im pretty sure he crossed himself He then placed the money to the side and helped me and Im not sure what happened next but I hope it worked out for him

Im about to graduate with a degree in a field that is heavily reliant on my sense of hearing but I recently found out that I already have mild hearing loss Did I really just get this stupidly expensive degree in a field where I might not even be able to compete in simply because I enjoyed the work Am I just fucked now
I think I am a pretty decent guy not like amazing in any one way but like I try to take care of my looks be conscious about internalized misogamy and try to be kind with everyone I meet Ive been on several dates had a couple serious relationships so I know I am not the worst person to date Im also not about to be like oh yeah More nice guys finish last thats why no one wants to date me because Im just too nice but like its been a long time since Ive really gone on a date an even longer time since I have had someone Ive really cared about And while I have had a lot of crushes nothings really ever happened and dating apps just kinda suck for me because Ive never been able to find the right time to transition from oh ok this is a real person not some serial killer into alright lets find a time to meet in person Idk I guess this is all to say dating kinda sucks and with the holidays I just really miss having someone I really care about to fall asleep with and be happy that I am with them
Is it weird that I make people sign a concent form with a witness present before sleeping with them 
So I got a concussion while drinking the other night 010 would not recommend All the balance problems memory loss and confusion of being reallyyyyy drunk none of the fun But hey now I have a great story 
Today I sat in the middle of union square park bawling because I realized someone I truly love will never love me back This person is viewed by others as nerdy socially awkward not popular average looking and many other things On the other hand Im considered somewhat attractive and wellrounded But regardless of what other people More might make of us my feelings toward him dont equal his toward mine It really sucked realizing that After a whole ass crying session I walked over to Farooks halal cart ate it in uhall lounge then cried some more in the park Thats it Im never gonna like anyone who doesnt like me back from now on
NYU has completely drained me of any motivation I had academically I came in with enough AP credits to be a sophomore so I was super jazzed to be able to take cool courses in my major faster But Ill be wasting my first two semesters taking stupid requirements like intro to CS and the EG classes Ive only taken 15 credits both More semesters and I just cant deal with the fact that Im wasting so much time Learning excites me so much and my dream is to one day get my PhD but because Im just sitting on my ass wasting time filling requirements I worry I wont still be driven when I get to the top of the ladder 
I dated a professor for a while when I was a freshman and we had the most amazing time together He was charming charismatic and taught a graduate class related to my major Things didnt work out in the end no nasty breakup no drama sorry folks but we have remained close Tonight I saw on Albert that he will be teaching a class I took before so I couldnt help but wonder should I apply to be his TA
Hey all Im really shook I was walking home at around 730pm on Saturday December 15th around Union Square from a heavy Carbo load and had my headphones in I was almost home when all of a sudden I hear someone yell get your nonAmerican asses out of here And I look up ahead and see a small family of Asian Americans rush to the side More of the side walk as a really tall and big white guy barrels past and away This is the first thing like this Ive ever encountered in real life and I was just so taken aback I didnt know what to do being a small white female walking home alone in the darkness But I knew something needed to be said so I went with instinct and turned around to More
I texted Do you wanna hang out sometime to a guy and this guy texted me back I cant do tonight but maybe another time Was I rejected Or is there going to be another time Im confused
One of the best ever feelings is that surge of elation upon realizing youre done with NYU for good That youre now comfortably insulated in a bastion where nobodydont want to name and shame can harm you Many of us were tangled in the vortex of academia while at NYU and it was so stifling and it sucked high time Our More mental wellbeing suffered and they were days on end where no light was visible at the end of the tunnel There was doom desperation and paranoia if anything To cut the long story short I say Good Riddance NYU 
Whenever I go to Manhattan I pull out my Arduino 50 mini grant from MakerSpace at Tandon and make a point to stress that I go to Tandon around other NYU kids to make them feel like shit sorrynotsorry

One of my hot straight friends borrowed a shirt when he stayed over last night and after he left I shot the biggest load jerking off to his scent
The girl I was dating found out that shes pregnant and now wants me to pay for her abortion
 I found this to be a pretty big ask considering that weve only been going out for 6 weeks and I havent had sex with her
 Needless to say Im no longer dating her
The people who actually want me around and involved in their lives make my blood boil Shit they say and do actually makes my head throb in pain Theyre ok people I care for their wellbeing but they are entirely unfulfilling company
 Meanwhile the people who I feel could be good friends just never seem that interested It makes me More wonder if its just a cycle and Im no more interesting or remarkable or intelligent than the same people I cant stand to be around It concerns me because Im starting to feel like I dont actually have friends
ive fallen in love with a guy who goes to a school about five hours away but is from NYC originally so is here over breaks and shit We met on tinder and like i thought it was just gonna be another hookup but we talk everyday and he sends me heart emojis and talks about being excited to see me but at the same time doesnt want a More relationship because of the distance ive been with people before him and ive been with people after him but he really feels special and I dont know how to approach him about it without coming off as obsessive because weve only hung out like four times
Im ashamed to go back home and talk about how my college experience has been so far Im halfway through my first year and I havent made any friends Most of the time Im too scared to step out of my dorm Even when I do I feel more alone because I see people with their friends laughing and talking I think Ive lost some of my speaking and interacting skills I dont know where to start to treat my social anxiety Its ruining my life and participation grade in class 
The security guard at 19 W 4th is such a daddy
Yo its the finals week and I thought I would hear more interesting stuff about what finals time does to people as opposed to how miserable their sex life is Looks like no one gives a damn about finals lol
I was dumped by someone that I thought I loved Everyone told me that our relationship just seemed off but I want her back in my life
Lately Ive been feeling furious and wound up like a clock all the fucking time I cant figure out why Im angry or whowhat Im angry at besides myself I have difficulty having normal conversations with people I keep accelerating my speech each sentence getting quicker and more forceful and more invective for no reason and I dont More even realize its happening until someone points it out The topic doesnt matter I could be talking about moss or clouds and itll still happen Its starting to affect me physically too constant tension and soreness in my shoulders and back shortness of breath etc
 Ive tried meditation tea yoga going for a long walk and other things like that but I cant seem to calm down much
I was rejected today BUT also accepted at the same time I proposed my girlfriend Guess which one went in which direction
All of my bestfriendships have never lasted more than an year and I always thought it was because of how the world works But recently Ive been thinking that Im probably the reason why my special friendships never last despite there were no fights or anything
Why are kids at NYU incapable of efficiently passing around a signin sheet Its really not that hard Geez
Is it just me or is it absolutely impossible to find people you connect with going to college in NYC This is a feeling Ive had for a while and Im curious how many people feel the same I went through high school with what I would consider a normal love life some relationships great not so great but at least they happened lol I had More a long term girlfriend coming into college and we decided to break up because we thought long distance would be tough and although I do think that was the right decision for both of us in the long run its hard not to doubt that decision when youve seemingly had less than 2 fluid ounces of romantic interest since youve gotten to college Ive More
Im still in love with my Freshman TA and this infatuation has made it impossible for me to have a relationship with anyone since I met him

Im still in love with my Freshman TA and this infatuation has made it impossible for me to have a relationship with anyone since I met him 
I have three finals left in my first semester of junior year and both this and the previous semester Ive seriously considered dropping out My mental health is making everything so difficult but Im afraid of deviating from a set path My mantra is one day at a time to keep the crushing horror of the future from doing me in I have a More supportive mom and a therapist and an incredible support network of friends but god I keep looking at the rest of my academic career and being terrified of it Not looking for advice just to vent
Saw a girl sitting in a sink while juuling yesterday Is this peak NYU
In the past I hooked up with guys because I thought I wanted to but now that Ive been in a relationship for over a year Im realizing that I was just using sex to fill an emotional void I never actually enjoyed it much Now that Ive been seeing my boyfriend for so long I cant bring myself to have sex anymore I love him and hes not bad in bed I just dont feel aroused at all and I never have He always respects when I say no but I can tell it bothers him that I havent wanted to have sex for months now
To the pendejo who is playing League of Legends in Bobst and wont stop clicking during final weeks we are gonna fight 
I met a guy who was really cute nice tall funny honestly really boyfriend material But I was in a relationship so I hadnt really thought about it then When my relationship ended he was there for me but a week later for some reason he stopped talking to me Was it because I didnt start dating him immediately It was honestly a little bit heartbreaking because I really liked him and valued our relationship Now I see him around campus and pretend I dont recognize him 
I was really drunk the other day and trying to get home I didnt realize that the 2 and 1 trains separated so far from each other Any way took the 2 and then had a 25 minute walk home I really had to pee and was near Columbia I figured they would have some bathrooms so went there Was too scared to try to walk into a building so hid in some bushes and peed When someone got close I got nervous so had a pretend phone call where I talked about being dared to hang out in the bushes for an hour
As a member of SJP I can assure you that the student who shut down the Bronfman Center with his threatening tweets was in fact one of our membersour leadership just didnt think it was a good look for our movement so we covered it up
Can someone explain how the hell nutrition ended up in Steinhardt 
Im taking one of those classes where youre mostly kept in the shadows about the grades you got on your assignments I just emailed my TA about how my grade was looking so far and he hit me with the if you do really well on your final exam and final paper 40 of my grade you can probably end with a B 
 Happy finals week everyone

I absolutely despise the rich kids here who claim that theyre Communists I dont know how to tell you this but when your socalled revolution comes youll be part of the rich who are eaten And if youre such a diehard Communist redistribute your wealth and pay my student loans
my parents are threatening to stop paying tuition and i dont know what to do
I didnt ask my teacher for an extension on my final paper that I desperately needed because I am terrified of social confrontations and now I dont know what to do 
Im only a sophomore but I feel so lonely here I hang out with a group of kids occasionally but they all like talking in their native language with each other more so I feel really left out sometimes because I dont understand Theyre the same kids I first talked to in freshman year but the more time I spend with them the more I More realize we have nothing in common and Im usually just there doing nothing I tried joining clubs but I still havent found even one person I just click with Im worried that when graduation comes around I wont have any lasting friends from NYU The only people I can actually talk to are my high school friends but theyve all made friends at their own schools and are busier Maybe Im doing something wrong maybe Im just unlikeable I dont know it just kind of sucks sitting alone in classes studying alone in the library and having most of my weekends free simply because I have no one to hang out with
Its almost the end of my first semester and I havent made a single friend I stay in my dorm all day too 
Im going 6 figures in debt for a degree that is crucial to allowing me to improve my familys circumstances since Im an only child I go to the library because its one of the few completely quiet places on campus to study Please protest somewhere other than Bobst during finals Im too fucking poor to want to deal with that shit
I was seeing this girl for the past few months We ended up staying as friends as she had a lot of issues to take care of financial etc Since I had extra money I would give it to her so she could take care of her bills etc 
 2 weeks ago she ended up ghosting me after I gave her 200 Since I thought something was wrong with her More phone I paid her cell phone and contacted her She still didnt answer Then I called her from a different phoneshe answered and we ended up having a massive falling out
 Tldr be kind but always be judicious There are some terrible people out there
I hate how everyone at NYU hates their hometown and thinks its a shame to move back to their hometown as if they were a dog crawling back to their hometown with their tail between their legs Whats wrong with moving back to your hometown after graduation I just graduated in May and moved back to my hometown and life is good Be yourself 
I am pretty sure I will marry my girlfriend of 5 years in the coming months I have been in NYC 3 years now went to NYU engineering grad school She is here since the past year and is in school Long distance sucked but I was super busy with school work I work now and she is about to land a job She is about to make a lot of money like 120 k a year She my future sugar mama I never expected that but its eventually gonna happen Life is gonna be a confusing yet fun ride I am sure 
This is going to be a long shot but whatever to the guy with red dirty blonde hair that was sitting next to me on the 7th floor of BOBST on a Friday afternoon and asked me to watch over your things when you momentarily left your seat wanna meet up I thought you were really cute I really wanted to talk to you more but it was the library you left earlier than me and I couldnt tell if you were gay or not
Recently all my friends from NYU turned on me Im not really sure why and why I am singled out But to be honest I havent really associated with them closely in awhile Ive been scrambling to graduate a semester early and have neglected all forms of life but school life Needless to say Im miserable and lost and somehow need my life More together within a few weeks While my career scares me so much it also scares me that I have no one now Classes that have my old friends are so awkward If my boyfriend ever decides to leave me Im fucking alone and that fucking scares me shitless Hes an encouraging guy and Im just trying to keep it together so I dont base him as my only sourse of happiness and fulfillment 
Checking NYU email every morning becomes one of the most exciting habit in life I know it sounds weird When I get bored I always unconsciously open school email first instead of Facebook or Instagram I extremely expect emails such as class announcement and others like your grade is up When I was chilling with my gf im embrassed to let her find that Im on NYU Email the whole time But I feel so much fun to get updates from school email Am I Sick
Final is actually killing me Whenever I have an essay due I cant stop biting my fingernails smoking or binge drinking till I give blowjob to cucumbers 
When I was first accepted to NYU for grad school I was ecstatic I always thought of NYU as a prestigious school and it felt like a privilege to be accepted but not many people in my life were happy for me Now Im always questioning did they accept me because like everyone said Why not As long as youre willing to pay their More expensive ass tuition theyll accept anyone or because they actually saw something in me Idk but its pretty shitty to feel so excited and proud of something for so long and have everything you once felt crushed
Im 21 Indian going bald and not that fit Im on Tinder and a bunch of other dating apps I basically get no matches Im scared as fuck about asking out people that I have a crush on Ive went out with three people in my entire life and all of them failed after the first date All of my friends are in relationships now and Im freaking out At this point I feel doomed I might as well fall into my parents peer pressure and get an arranged marriage What the fuck is wrong with me and what the hell do I do
For some reason other peoples scent easily rubs off on me so theres a give away sign to tell when Ive hooked up which is when I start smelling my jacket every 5 minutes I dont know why but I enjoy sniffing the other persons perfume since it brings back the pleasant memories of last night

Im an Asian girl who has been in New York for 6 years now and Im still scared to talk to anyone else than Asians I want to make whiteblackbrown friends but I literally get so overwhelmed to talk to them ever because I think they judge me for my ethnicity or not perfect English skills I know society made me this way but I dont know how to change that 
As an Asian fob my dating options are so severely limited that I almost feel being rammed against the wall The Asian Americans hate us the African Americans hate us the people of European descent hate us the Hispanics hate us the Pacific Islanders hate us the MiddleEasterners hate us I try to put up an affectation so that my More accent doesnt get noticed by the unsuspecting eye I try not to be vulnerable and act super calm while in public I try hard to slip amid the Asian Americans I rank among the top five students in my class People always want me in their study groups when the tests draw near and they particularly appreciate how lucidly I teach them everything in a relatively short span of time But outside of that very feeble success Ive been mocked and ridiculed on a few occasions for even aspiring to date an American and how Ill never have one Perhaps theyre right Only a few months until I get out of here Sigh 
My best friend and I met through similar mental health struggles and before we get too ahead I really do want to stress that I love her and that shes the best thing that has ever happened to me and our friendship is more than free therapy but for the purpose of this secret were going to pause here Shes further along in her More recovery from this mental health issue that we met through but was diagnosed with an umbrella mental illness back in the spring that scares me to talk about Not because she scares me shes the least threatening person on the planet but because I see so much of myself in her that Im scared to also have this mental illness because of the stigma it More
Im pretending to be friends with a girl in my studio who is in love with me Why I know she has a massive crush on me because she told a friend who then told me I dont really like her that much even just as a person shes very weird and I definitely dont find her very attractive She is very wellliked within the group but know More that Im not as popular People dont dislike me but they definitely dont like me as much as they like her Yet because of her crush on me she keeps inviting me to parties and keeps me in the loop So Ive just kept pretending to be friends with her so that I dont get exiled from this group It feels bad because I feel like Im lying to her by giving her false hope but also I dont want to be an outcast StellaAdlerProblems

I was bi in my mind in my early teen years suppressed it my late teens and just busted the biggest nut a few days ago to a bicurious threesome porn Im curious but STDs scare me shitless and I have the confidence of a 12 year old with a body of a 14 year old 
I had a pregnancy scare this past month after completely missing my period and although my boyfriend acted pretty calm he said a couple of things that kind of concern me That being that he borderline accused me of purposely getting pregnant to keep him in the relationship by saying just so you know if you had a baby I wouldnt stay More with you so dont even attempt it as a way to lock me down Where he comes from women apparently do this often but I hate that he lumps me together with those type of people Why I would I be on birth control and freaking out if I were trying to have a baby Not to mention Im in my early 20s with a bright future ahead of me Its kind of insulting that he thought Id purposely get pregnant to keep him and ruin my own life No boo boo that shit aint happening for anyone Needless to say I am now on my period and happier than ever but I kind of want to slap my boyfriend for being so stupid 
Sometimes I read the comments on these secrets and I realize how petty so many NYU kids are Like yall are salty and petty af You all complain about secrets not being secret enough and when a good one does come along everyone is like fakeee Some of you need to be slapped dios mío 
The longest relationship Ive been in lasted less than 6 months Ive done like 23 dates with a handful of girls always attractive and intelligent but it never gets anywhere Im a virgin Im now over 25 years old Life is going ok and I dont always look like complete trash so I feel like I could actually have a decent More relationship and healthy sex life if I put myself out there and gave it my all But school has made it hard to really try
 I also kinda have no clue where to even begin I mean Ill probably do whatever you want in the bedroom because I like making girls happy But youll probably have to tell me what you like I mean that seems like it should be More
I am so disappointed in my life seeing all these people around me so happy loved and with such strong friendships I wanted that so much for myself I put in so much effort to be involved really put myself out there and still it has yielded next to nothing People say that were all just as lonely here at NYU I do not see it It must really only be me
Is it healthier to love someone but not the nature of your relationship but love being in the relationship but not the person Ive been keeping up with this string of endingfirstrelationship secrets and Im terrified that Ill be next Is there a club or something where everyone who has been posting about their breakups are joining Would be nice to know where Im headed Cheers
As a master student I have never been in a relationship Its not like I m ugly or something but now I feel like maybe its my personality or appearance prevent me from having a partner The guys just dont feel the same way as I did Since I came to NYU nobody ever showed interest in me Its super sucks and I feel like I m gonna die alone
As a guy theres on thing that secretly turns me on but Ive never told anyone cause its pretty weird Out of oral anal and vaginal there is a secret order that makes me go crazy and hint its not something youd expect 
 Spoiler Bonus if its both at the start and the end Also bare as in no condoms I dont know why but watching someone ride me and then finishing me off with a blowjob is hot 
As any typical guy story I fell in love with my best friend who is a female Every time I am with her I feel like I can carry the world on my shoulders and life would not stop me But she does not see me that way or at least I think she doesnt and Ive never really had the balls to actually tell her because of rejection and also More the fear of losing her Shes an amazing girl who I cherish deeply but unfortunately I feel that if I admit it to her that shell feel awkward and then things will get complicated I had to swallow my pride and everyday it irks me that I couldnt tell her how much she means to mean It kills me too how much of a fucking coward I am just because I couldnt be honest with her But I feel Im already way deep in the friend zone so thats pretty much a lost cause am I right
Ive had a pretty hard time at NYU Ive had multiple mental breakdowns and had to take over three breaks from school Its been hard getting back on track and pushing through towards graduation I have lost a lot of friends along the way and am now pretty much alone Its hard for me to make friends because Im a very anxious person I More dont know where I can meet new people as of right now I have only a few friends I recently ended things with a boy I was seeing for months because I felt he was only in it for the sex I now know that he actually really cared for me and I really regret breaking up with him I want to try to get him back because he was the happiest part of my life for the past few months Any ideas on how to get him back Im really struggling and need to find a way to win him back
I went through a pretty tough break up a few month ago and i know I should be making steps forward but instead Ive gone to this really dark place Its hard because I know that he wasnt the right person yet at the same time I miss him so much or maybe its just the idea of him I cant figure it out Ive never thought that nyc could be such a lonely place 
How do I tell my boyfriend I want him to start working out more He used to be much more in shape and work out regularly He has lost most of the muscle definition he had before I dont want him to think Im shallow but fitness is something that is important to me I exercise and eat healthy foods to maintain my figure and I would like him to do the same
I still live with my parents so all my letters naturally get delivered to our home address My dad took it upon himself to open all the letters no matter who its for including the monthly bank statement addressed to me Parents found out I spent money playing games and roasted me nonstop Should have gone paperless Fuck

Ok this is not a secret but Im sure many people are feeling this too Why are some musicart programs in Steinhardt Its so confusing to nonNYU people even to NYU people and thats probably why the level of these programs is not as good as they should be They should just combine all visual and performing arts programs into one school Administrators Wake up
Im graduating in less than a year but still dont feel like Ive gotten the college experience For the past three years Ive just been stressed out about exams and hanging out with my friends every so often Ive never gone to a frat party had a wild night out etc I wanna be stupid and have fun before I graduate but Im just not cool enough Lol
Ive been in therapy since I was 13 and something just clicked Im starting to love myself Im allowing myself to have a good time allowing myself not to care what others think and leading my own path I was the person who cared about everything someone said and thought that I was such a horrible piece of shit for years My therapist More said the only shitty thing I was doing was abusing myself Afterwards it took time but Im learning not to be overly judgmental of myself Im leading life with such a different outlook Im still working on it but as I start becoming less mean to myself everything just starts to brighten up 
Weekend before last I went to a warehouse party with the intent of heavy substance abuse At one point during the night I was in a conversation with one of the door guys who had just come off duty just shooting the shit Guy was complaining that people manage to consistently fuck up kobe and yeet you kobe a 3 pointer from the More corner you yeet a 3 pointer from half court or further Fun conversation while I was trying to settle back into merely heavily fucked up from blackout

Why so many people on this page talking about sex all day I get the whole idea that sexual desire is a human need but frankly speaking I am so tired of only seeing sperm and egg smelly posts about how much time spent for having sex daily here and there Is that only secret yall horny pseudo intellectuals have Then your life must be so trivial and banal
I confided in an NYU CAS advisor about how an expartner was spreading lies labeling me as abusive and manipulative The incident has placed me in a bad mental health place and I asked for confidentiality from this adviserwhom I considered a friend However she showed my email under the cover to the opposing party Should I report More this academic advisor to the dean 
 If I wanted to share my feelings with the individual who is seeking to ruin my life I would have However I could have easily been someone who is in a worse place and this advisors actions could have provoked a more serious actions from another student Im tired of NYU faculty not respecting students
Just moved in with my boyfriend and I think he slapped me in the face last night while I was sleeping and told me to stop snoring Or maybe it was a dream 
My first time having sex was without a condom and there was no birth control I dont know why but ever since then I just love f without a condom One out of every of my four hook ups is condomless and Ive gotten a few STDs already I know its bad but I love feeling the other person on me too much

Almost a year ago I hooked up with a tinder guy We talked all night I still think about him constantly We had incredible sex which he admitted was the best he ever had and probably for me too We really connected on multiple levels and every time I start to forget about him he hits me up again just to talk when Im least expecting More it Im never really home for breaks anymore so we havent seen each other since Ive been with guys since then during which I forget about him for a little while but then when the new guy fades away Im hardly bothered and go right back to thinking about the tinder guy I cant seem to move on from him but we literally only hooked up once a More
I made a lot of friends freshman year but various circumstances caused us to drift apart as early as sophomore year even while I was living with some of them Now as I get ready for my final semester at NYU I see tons of posts and pictures on FB that make me miss them Or at least the idea of them Maybe I wouldnt feel so bad if More I also had a group of friends to post about but I really only have 1 friend at NYU and we only met a couple months ago I have a lot of social anxiety so some people view me as standoffish mostly because of my monotone voice and tendency to make bad jokes when Im uncomfortable 
 Ive never seen anybody talk about this kind of thing but its More
Im a chick was dating this rlly amazing girl from NYU Tisch Ik my mistake We broke up and blamed me for the whole thing I still miss her but she doesnt want anything to do with me I know she posts about me on her finsta and it bothers me I want her back but I feel like since shes graduating soon Whats the point

To the drunk asshole in McDs two nights ago you should probably ditch your the people who led you to believe that being a gay twink gives you free license to act like an unrepentant prick and pass it off as being sassy Theyre not your friends Clapping every two or three syllables doesnt make what youre saying more correct and More dumping your trash on someone elses tray is not a classy insult 
 Finally and this is the kicker just because you know that youre physically incapable of injuring someone of my stature doesnt mean its a good idea to try and throw the punch anyway Youre kind of playing the social version of russian roulette when you do that You were certain for whatever reason I wasnt going to retaliate but you were scared fucking shitless when the smaller black guy in the next booth started looking in your direction 
A friend of mine got pregnant by an older guy she just recently met The guy seems like he cares for her but they have only known each other for a short time and I doubt if thats enough to make a lifelong decision over I cant say anything to her since she has decided to go through with it and I feel like its not my place to say More anything but a part of me also thinks she has not really thought it out clearly Like she will obviously have to drop out of school or take a break raise a baby before she is even 21 and worry about getting a job to support herself and pay off student loans Am I a bad friend for thinking like this
Just like any other typical guy love story I started to develop feelings for my best friend who is a female Its kind of sad and pathetic on my part that I actually never told her how I felt about her My biggest fear in my life is losing people Ive had familyfriendshipspast relationships whom Ive been very close eventually leave More due to circumstances Shes honestly one of the most genuine people I care about and it would suck and awkward too if I ended up or she discovering that I do have feelings for her Every time Im with her I feel like Im falling but shes the one that makes me feel like I can fly I just wished the first time we met and hung out I had the balls to tell her but Im wayyyyyyyy too deep in the friend zone now that Im hopeless af
I met a guy from subtle asian traits who said he went to NYU I decided since he seemed nice that I go visit him in the park Im not an actual NYU student btw Turns out he goes to TANDON not like actual NYU Like Im a manhattan girl I aint going all the way to Brooklyn for a relationship Needless to say when he told me that I immediately ran away from him and took the A train to Times Square to get a drink

I understand the impetus behind telling people that its not good to have an emotional wall up all the time I just wish that more people understood that emotional wall works both ways and is designed not only to protect oneself from others but also to protect others from oneself
 Ive seen far too many people interpret being more emotionally open and transparent as license to completely abdicate manners self control and personal conduct in public
I had a long fling with a guy It started out as just sex but we both started to like each other We never defined anything but it just kept going on for months I got tired of not knowing what was actually going on but couldnt see myself dating him either I ended things with him a few weeks ago but now I really regret doing it I More miss him and it took us breaking up for me to realize how I truly felt about him We havent been in contact for a while but I know from his friends that he was pretty torn up over it I want him back in my life but dont know how to do that How do you win someone back after breaking their heart Honestly tell me any and all advice is welcome seriously I need help
Last semester I took a class and got B I went to professor fake cried and he changed the grade to A
Once I had to withdraw from a class because I was so hungover that I vomited on my midterm and got 10 I said I had food poisoning 
Ive always been sure NYU was the right place for me During the application process and during the first part of my year I was confident NYU was a perfect place for my personality However the more time goes on the more fed up I am with the student population here even though I love the city I feel like I have no friends except one More who doesnt go out much and at this point I dont even know how to try to get to know other people Its been really hard to spend FridaySaturday nights alone when Im used to having so many good friends near me in high school The pre med commmunity here really sucks and it feels like everyone is cliquey and competitive Also everyone seems More
After taking my Stern Portfolio Management midterm I really regret not transferring to CAS Econ back when I first realized how I bad I am at finance I stuck with Stern because of the name and goals but now I realize what a dumb reason that was 
What I lost at NYU in football games and tailgating I made up for by getting a blowjob in the Palladium piano room
Its funny because I used to think my ex was my first love but now I just think it was all obsession and infatuation I genuinely think my current boyfriend is my first love because I dont spend day and night obsessing over whether Ill get a text or not and I genuinely care for him his goals and his family For the longest time Ive More been telling people that I learned what love is from my ex but honestly thats a lie I was young and immature and felt like I needed a relationship to hold my life together But now that Ive been with my boyfriend for a little over a year Ive realized that this is what love should be like I feel free in this relationship independent and fully myself Funny how you can believe youve loved someone for years and then someone else comes along the way and proves you wrong Dont force a relationship to last ladies if they want to stay they will You need to feel free and safe not obsessed and worried 
A few months ago Ive developed a crush on a very close friend of mine Unfortunately Im a guy and as far as I know hes straight Ive tried persuading myself that I should move on to someone else who would reciprocate my feelings and I know that telling him would probably jeopardize our existing friendship Yet part of me just wishes More that I could confess and have him crush my dreams once and for all since I dont seem to be able to truly move on Its been gnawing at me for a while and I dont see any good options available What should I do
I hate being single I broke up with my long term SO recently and I feel like its too late for me to find someone else and start a family Im super fulfilled in all other areas of my lifeamazing friends job I love grad school is going greatbut starting a family of my own means more to me than anything else and its the only thing More I dont have Im doing and hating the whole online dating thing but while Im working hard and moving forward in all other areas of my life the one thats the most important to me is the one I feel like I have the least control over And Im happy for the most part but I hate this a lot
So Im dating a camgirl Have been since I was 18 Weve been together for three years and its great but as it is she lives in Romania Shes about 6 years older than me and the best thing that happens to me The problem is I dont have a way to contact her outside her job so I usually am broke I love her a lot but dont know More what to do to close the gap We know a lot about each other on a personal and emotional level but Im terrified about my future The fact is Im in college and shes attempting to become a pharmacist The fact is I could just cheat and fuck around but at the same time I want more Fuck me
I am studying for MCAT about 4 to 8 hrs per day and watch porn every 50 minutes 
I have a friend that Ive sent a dick pic to on the last two Christmases He thinks hes safe this year but hes getting that pic
I just feel absolutely terrible all the time Ive dealt on and off mostly on with depression for the past eight years and its at its absolute worst right now even though Im graduating college this year and have so much to look forward to After years of self harm and introspection in high school I finally thought I was past all of More this but being far away from home and extremely stressed out in college has only made this worse Im anxious and numb all the time and recently started cutting again Its gotten so bad that its no longer a coping mechanism I think about dying and suicide all the time now I would never actually go through with it but Ive honestly just never More
So there have been a lot of secrets recently about heartbreak over first loves As a person going through it myself feeling the extreme pain that feels like it will never go away I guess my question for all those people reading this is how do you put yourself out there again and let yourself love again after feeling the pain of heartbreak and does it get easier with every relationship ie going through a breakup 
Since there seems to be a relationship secret thing going onI broke up with my first love recently and while I dont want them or the relationship back I find myself kinda scared of my single future It was so toxic but at least it was something I was pretty sure nobody would ever love me before them what if nobody else loves me like that again 
Im gay and plan A is to live an unmarried life because that sounds better than coming out to Chinese parents or marrying and ruining a hetero womans life to save my own But Ive definitely contemplated about the idea of marrying a lesbian woman whos also on board with the idea Since neither of us are willing to come out to our More parents or live our lives being happy and ourselves it would be nice though to at least have someone to share the same struggles as you for the rest of this life while putting up this facade as a hetero couple Anyway its not happening so Im just going to make a long list of things to do for the next 60 years or so Its going to be one very long metime Lol
I walked into my room to discover my suite mate and roommate having gay sex and immediately ran out wtf do I say to them when I go back Neither of them came out 
I just graduated in May I have a good job and am doing well for myself 
 But honestly I feel that there is zero point to my life now I grew up poor with a single mother and I worked hard at school and everything else so that we could eventually lift ourselves out of poverty I wanted to make sure I never saw my mom skip a meal because More we couldnt afford it ever again
 The problem is that my mom is doing really well on her own now she got a big promotion and raise my senior year of college and so I have no reason to really keep on going I dont really care about prestige or money I have no interest in romance and my hobbies dont lend themselves to being profitable as a More
 Went to a strip club for the first and probably last time ever recently
 Intellectually its not difficult to explain the appeal You have women dancing on stage or coming over and keeping you company its their job to pretend to give a shit
 Knowing that its all a farce made me severely anxious Every little facial twitch seemed to More betray some deep visceral disgust and after only about 15 minutes I felt some of the worst nausea I could remember experiencing subsequently followed by throwing up pretty much everything Id eaten that day 
to evade the upcoming doom of final exams Im going to eat a shit ton of romaine lettuce and hope I get hospitalized
Thanksgiving break was eye opening for so many reasons Its weird as an adult now living on my own in my own apartment as well as working at a job and going to school going back home to the place I grew up I guess the big takeaways were that 1 all the things my mother blamed my sibling and I for as kids werent our fault because More weve moved out and the problems are still there So all of the personal faults Ive carried with me for decades were never real It was truly her and the reality of being a child the whole time 2 It doesnt matter how much education I have or how smart I am technically my family is never going to respect that because they are a bunch of ignorant More
Im finally trying to get myself out there after a pretty brutal break up but I forgot how hard dating can be Any suggestions on where to meet genuine people 
It is not ABSOLUTELY MANDATORY to comment Weird flex but okay on every goddamn post

When a guy tells you hes not looking for anything serious and dont initiate any conversations after the first meeting up should I just move on I really like this guy and am thinking about him almost 247 How can I move on Just go fuck other guys
Someone brought a dog to the dorm floor and its one of those small dogs that yap nonstop I have never wanted to punt a dog so hard in my life

Wise words from a hot girl even if you dont think u have a shot u probably have a shot
Instead of telling me that I was stupid my ex used to say that I had a different kind of intelligence and then tell all of his friends that I was stupid He integrated himself into my friend group and convinced all of them he was healthy for me We were that picture perfect couple In reality he was controlling and would control where More I went and literally tracked where I went with his phone When we broke up he told everyone how much of a bitch I was and how abusive I was Most of my friends cursed me out and took his side and called me a slut I moved on to a different guy whose a manager at a large investing company He said he had to interview this guy that struck him as kind of weird He showed me his linkedin and it was my ex So I basically black balled him and called my other friends to reject him by telling them what he did Karma 
I am completely normal on the outside with great friends and an amazing family But on the inside Ive been completely obsessed with a guy Ive known for years who I grew up with in my hometown He is perfect in every way I think about him 247 There is absolutely nothing I wouldnt do for him and if I had to choose Id give up all More of my friends and family just to be with him I see all other men as pathetic lesser versions of him The women who flirt with him could never appreciate him and his greatness like I could I have not told him about how I feel because just his presence alone has been enough so far I realize this is pretty unhealthy as I even made a drastic career change because I wanted to impress him I dont know if I should get help or if this is just who I am since Ive had no childhood traumas that could ever explain this I feel like Id fall apart without him yet I have otherwise a pretty normal selfesteem and thriving socialprofessional life I do not know if this is something to seek therapy for
For a long time I thought I was completely incapable of love Then I met someone and he lit up my world About a year later he decided to end our relationship because he was trying to follow a life plan he formulated well before me I was shattered I thought my world was going to end Only recently did I realize that he wasnt right for More me and while we were together I completely lost myself and became complacent in the relationship So now here I am picking up all the pieces wondering if Ill be able to love again after that world of hurt
I suffer from borderline personality disorder and it causes me to push away anyone that gets too close to me I feel so bad when i actually like the person though and its really difficult for me to express my feelings as doing so really pains me But not expressing my feeling eventually leads to the person I like just going away More Theres one person in particular that was honestly the smartest person I think ive ever met I think he understood me like no one else and we supported each other but I couldnt handle how close I felt to him If youre reading this I love you M and I miss you
I am almost 21 and I am still single I have not even kissed a guy Looking at my situation I feel like I will stay like this forever which is not necessarily bad I dont mind staying single but there are few moments where I want to be in relationship badly I am scared that I will get desperate or pressured to be in relationship and More will pick a wrong person I also dont want to talk to someone because I want to be in relationship with them I want to get to know a person and like that person for his personalities I think its my fault for being single I am kind of introvert and I like people with introvert personality So they dont make the move and I dont make the move most of the time either
I recently went through my first heartbreak I dont think anyone can really prepare you for how bad its going to be I just dont want to feel the way I feel right now
Im studying in bobst and a fingernail flicks right onto my keyboard There is no one within 15 feet of me so now I am both disgusted and impressed
Im male and I secretly masturbate in the females bathroom because its my fetish
Losing my first love has made me feel nothing towards men Its crazy how you can go from being so loving and selfless and invested in somebody to being completely heartless towards others Dont get me wrong I dont go out and make peoples lives miserable but since my first love Ive had a couple of boyfriends who love and care for me More and I just know my care for them is shallow In a way I hate myself for it I feel myself becoming a monster but at the same time if I can lose someone so special then I dont really give a shit about losing anybody else 
 I hope its a case of just not having met the right person I hope it wont be like this forever
I broke up with my boyfriend over the summer and I miss being in a relationship SO MUCH Its not that I dont like being single my life is pretty good right now and Im generally happy but I miss all the little everyday things about being in a LTR and I really really want to find those again Im putting myself out there and doing More the whole dating thing but I hate every damn second of it I hate the dating apps I hate meeting new people in this weird ass context I hate literally everything about dating But I want to find a relationship thatll actually be good for me so very much and I dont know what else to do about it
Open relationships are fun because they test the bonds of a pair For me the third wheel its an escapade Ive met almost 20 open relationship couples and each time theyve told me that having outside sex is okay because it doesnt mean anything besides fun Ive always rebutted with shouldnt sex with your one partner be fun enough More to satisfy you and Ive been told that just because a pair doesnt have good sex doesnt mean theyre soul mates nearly 20 times
 I pretend I understand them however I go in with the intent to steal Maybe its a few solo sessions or a couple of threesomes but out of the 20 times Ive ripped one partner away from the other Im responsible for making them love me Haha thats too bad its not my problem 
 I know its a pretty cruel thing to do but its fun and it keeps me busy Looking for another open couple if anyone wants to finally show me they can work 
A year a go I didnt give a damn about people who have or had a racial fetish and I would have happily gone out with any one who had one cause ultimately it would have benefited me Im a dude So what changed 
 Understanding what the fetish actually is Its not just I only like this one race Most of these people are willing to More hook up with any person as long as their race is right Meaning even if theyre just a 210 theyre good enough cause they are racial perfect I just ended a year long relationship today because I talked about past hook ups with my ex bad idea anyway and she has been with dudes who are hideous but the same race as me Whats so bad about this More
I have commitment issues because my first real boyfriend in high school kind of cheated on me and ever since than I have been scared to date or like someone because of getting hurt after and trust issues Whenever I think I like someone later I realize that I was just bored or because I had sex with them and felt like I should have More emotional connection with them as well I know doing the same shit to the same person is bad but to my last boyfriend I was a huge bitch and played him around so hard I feel bad now but back then I thought I was having so much fun and tbh I did Its probably karma that I got no boys now except maybe booty calls As of now I have almost no hope in liking someone for real in the future Im not ranting or anything and I should be over the boyfriend I had so many years ago but it is still scary and I dont know how to be not scared of having feelings Its just sad that I have to try to have feelings for someone 
I just turned 24 this year and Im so scared that Ill never be able to find someone who will love me and start a little family with me
As an Asian I find the recent trend of avoiding other Asians for relationships pretty sickening Theres nothing wrong with having a racial preference but specifically avoiding other Asians means that there is something seriously wrong with you if you cant find someone of your own race attractive Whether its in the straight community More or gay community the amount of times Ive encountered Asians exclusively seeking whiteblacklatinx partners is honestly absurd and I just get shocked by how many people actually suffer from this sort of internalized racism Im all for interracial couples dont get me wrong here but it IS racist towards yourself and others if youre ACTIVELY seeking such a relationship
Props to NYU swimming for choosing that manly well tanned handsome guy on their poster ad being circulated around campus Rumour has it that all his posters have mysteriously been disappearing fot the last couple of days I wonder who is doing that 
After graduating from here decided it would be wise to marry young and find an intellectual partner I can grow with Now all I want to do is go back to my fuck boy mentality and bang as many girls as I can TLDR never marry its not worth it
Trying to figure out a way to meet up with my hookup buddy back home over the thanksgiving break Normally itd be easy to find the time but my family is trying to spend basically every second with me Im desperate guys I cant spend another 3 months with nothing but my vibrator to keep me company 
To the girl sitting next to me in Bobst today you dont need to go to the library to eat obnoxiously loud snacks and watch Kdramas
I met this person in an NYU club Really sweet smart and fun I on the other hand am incredibly anxious around people and thats the reason why I joined said club to not be afraid But when the said person talked to me I froze and now cannot talk to them And Everytime I see them it becomes more and more difficult I wish I could go back in time and have a normal conversation with them I wish I can stop being so idiotic around people and actually talk to them 
Ex who currently goes to NYU broke it off with me to date a guy who went to Columbia University This was a while back when I had no direction no money and no drive Just want to say that if she ever comes across this post If its posted I finally understand I practically held you back from your true potential You were growing More intellectually mentally more so than I was at a faster rate You had goals needs and aspirations in life you wanted to fulfill with someone by your side of the same caliber and all I wanted to do was be a potato on the couch and do nothing There was no growth or improvement on my end back then She was a woman who loved to plan for the future and see it out in every way she could I was the type of person to do things in the now and free fall wherever life took me I was immature irrational and overbearing and Its honestly my fault for not being the man I should have been back then Where ever she is what ever shes doing I hope shes doing well striving at this university and fulfilling what shes been working to accomplish
Im 27 and still a virgin mostly because I never thought I was good enough to deserve to try 
 At this point Im weighing contacting a sex worker simply so I wont look completely retarded if and when its showtime against achieving wizard status
A lot of the friends I made in Freshman year kind of suck It hurts because we were all so happy and had so much fun together when we were in the dorm but now that were in apartments we have tougher classes internships etc it seems like nobody has time for each other I thought I was way closer with a lot of people and it turns out More that outside of a group dynamic its kind of hard to find stuff to talk about other than about other people in the group
 I try to make time for everyone and reach out but after being turned down or cancelled on time and time again Im not even sure if I should keep trying At the same time I dont really have any other options friendwise Being in an apartment and having a packed schedule doesnt leave a lot of room for being social and as we all know NYU isnt the best school for making new friends past Freshman year 
 Im not sure what to do If you dont meet your best friends in college when are you supposed to meet them
I talk openly about my mental health issues which are mostly in the past Ive been in therapy and on meds for over a decade working really hard to combat my issues and its worked miracles I havent had a panic attack in years and my depression is nonexistent I acknowledge my privilege having good insurance that covers my amazing More outofnetwork doctor NYU insurance actually doesnt suck financial stability and family support All that being said I have friends who talk to me about their mental health which is a great step but they also tell me that for xyz reasons theyre not going to therapy or taking meds Theyre not doing anything to help themselves except More
My girlfriend broke up with me because I wouldnt stop spending money on Love Live mobile rhythm game about singing schoolgirls based on an anime about said schoolgirls
 She just despised the concept behind the show was uncomfortable that I associated myself with it and repeatedly told me I was spending an unhealthy amount of money on merchandise and inapp purchases
 On the bright side now I have more money to spend on Love Live
Is it normal to become completely apathetic towards relationships Like seriously I dont know if Im just meeting all the wrong guys or what it is but I havent felt anything other than physical attraction towards a guy in a long time It might be that I just need to meet more people but every weekend I go out makeout with strangers whose names I dont learn and move on Sleep with the occasional standout This isnt healthy right
Even though I have been seeing a psychiatristpsychologist for over four years I still hate myself and have bad suicide idealization I hate when I cant go to class and just feel like shit afterwards I dont think the people in my group realize how much I hate myself when I cant be there and how shitty I feel when I dont show up More They probably think Im just lazy and using my mental health as an excuse to not show it It just sucks because I just feel like I dont belong anywhere Id never do anything to myself but it just sucks to be in a constant circle of everything 
While growing up I never indulged in verbal abuse As a result I only learnt how to utter appreciative and good words in English though I did constantly hear people abusing in my first language Now its kinda helping me because whenever I am upset or frustrated from my roommates activities I abuse her in my first language which More makes me feel a lot better At the same time its also good for her because she doesnt get to hear how big of a shit show she is The other day I also heard her talking to someone about how people in her class constantly ignore her which is not surprising but I feel so good when I see her suffering
I still want my ex even though hes proven time and again hes a dick I dont know what this hold he has on me is Logically it makes no sense for me to still want him and I know that and try to work off that but it doesnt help The cliche answers meet new people and time heals all dont work for me cause its been a while I even started seeing a therapist but she cant help me figure out how to get over him either Its very isolating feeling stuck in this position and hes the one I want to turn to for comfort
The toilet paper in Kimmel Center is the WORST toilet paper Ive ever used It cant cost that much more for a brand that wont break when youre using it 
More of a rant than a secret but I feel like NYU needs a speed dating event or something Like no shade against nonmonogamous people but I wanna meet guysgirls outside of a night clubbarapp but I feel like theres no such placeeventgroup Startup sneks or NYU club founders get working
Ive begun to realize that no matter how cute the guys are here I have a specific type I just cant resist a cute gay European boy
