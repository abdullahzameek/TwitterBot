I found this article interesting as it discussions the ethnic diversity among the Emirati population their cultural roots and the way that citizenshipmuch more than color or heritagedefines More Emiratis and their selfperception as Arab At least to an extent as it touches on how discrimination still occurs No points to make here just some interesting reading for those of us who know little on this and perhaps a good conversation starter for the Emirati students on campus to share their perspective httpswwwopendemocracynetbeyondslaverybtsanonymousthemultiplerootsofemiratiness
This is definitely the wrong forum but I dont want any pseudocriticisms made on my intentions on sharing this Just thought it was a good read

I graduated two years ago from a pretty good university in America Im still unemployed I moved back in with my parents and I have no idea what Im doing with my life I often come to NYUAD for events but it always brings back memories of my negative experience in college I had no friends or relationships and I was so so alone in a big More city Only now I realize that I was suffering from severe depression and anxiety And I mean locking myself up in my dorm for days bingeing drinking crying talking to myself avoiding classes large crowds public transportation My only human contact was through hookup apps that left me hating myself more Even though im a bit healthier now More

I think the idea behind the candidate weekend is insignificant it raises students egos so much and creates such a sense of devastation in the ones who were not invited If they truly and really want to hold a candidate weekend they should do so after the final decision of acceptance or rejection has been received in order to give More students a taste of how life is really like and explore the campus So really if that is what they want why not do it to the students who will be accepted what is the point of giving so much hope to a student when theres a slight chance that theyll be rejected
Im already drained off completely graduating in about two months and I have no idea what Im doing next Its sometimes better not to have a plan than having one and something going wrong last minute Great But thinking how 70 of 2019 Class does not have jobs secured is scary market here is going down professors rejecting us for More research saying youre graduating in May bring your own funding and I can employ you dude for f sake really Am I going to ask you to employ me knowing that Im graduating and have no money
Why are some people professors so inhumane Its not that Im complaining its me trying to be realistic they were once in our shoes and need More

I finally found the courage to share this even if anonymously Ever since I got on campus I cant seem to connect in a significant way with other people from my country I always feel left behind unnoticed ignored unwanted misunderstood and out of place when being in their company as if I cant seem to contribute anyhow to the More conversations in the group we have or at least this is how I perceive it I struggle enormously with interacting with them communicating and sharing any kind of personal experience with them as I dont feel they will or want to understand me Every timewhether I am with them or on my own I always seem to compare myself to each of them and put myself More

I feel like Im trapped here at NYUAD because Im a different person here and a different person anywhere else Im very anxious stressed lonely and exhausted at the end of the day I really enjoyed my Jterm and the people I was surrounded with We never stressed over course work even though our class was intense Similar to my study away More I always had anyone beside me and was excited for every new day Its very different here Ive joined SIGs and go to events yet Im trapped in campus Everyone is always busy and hardly find time to hang out Ive gone through depressions and counselors and that has helped but I barely can go beyond that although I wake up positive and ready to take on the day Is there anyone in a similar situation What makes this place different in the negative sense compared to others
Overheard at NYUAD Are your professors like mentally stable
Am I the only one There are a number of professors whom I wont call out by name that put their personal work above their students I struggled with this problem so much in the past and I didnt know how to approach it Some professors were too busy traveling working on their own papers or research this made it extremely hard to reach More out to them In many situations it resulted in affecting my own grades and entirely changed my academic path and was only told to let it go in the end But why is the blame that influences our grades in the end always put on the student when there is more to follow on This is considering that the student is partly in the wrong but not the full 100 percent But wouldnt it mean that because it wasnt the students fault entirely that more couldve been done Did anyone else encounter this before
I knew this was gonna happen but now Im freaking out Last fall was a terrible semester for me mental health wise I know I did terribly and I was in touch with HW and the dean of students office over it But I just got a letter saying I am 8 credits behind and on probation and I would be considered for dismissal or suspension if I dont get Cs and above this spring I really dont want to lose the opportunity that NYUAD is due to stuff that was outside my control What does all this mean Was anyone in a similar situation before

As a student trying to secure an internship or a job I am starting to find it odd and intimidating to ask current students and alumni about their current and previous professional experiences Some people are very friendly However some think I am literally exploiting them for my benefit while I wouldnt care about them otherwise I was More told that explicitly The truth is I am not using anyone here I am also happy to help anyone in need I simply cannot keep in touch with everyone on a regular basis which seems to be a requirement if you ever need help in the future Any advice
So are we just not going to talk about the crippling anxiety and completely debilitating sensation that comes with senior year I feel paralyzed by such a deep fear when I think about graduation and what happens after I cant be the only senior feeling this way can I Why isnt anyone talking about this Im fucking terrified
I strongly agree with 3361 Our school invests way too much capital and effort in trying to promote its presence and the narrative that NYU Abu Dhabi is a revolutionary liberal arts college Our significance and contribution to society should be felt passively and naturally not through associating big names with us The school may be avoiding popular news sources like Gloria Borger and Poppy Harlow but arent differing opinions and contradicting narratives the reason we are here in the first place

Im certain someone posted this before but I need to do it again Just because Im Emirati doesnt mean Im brainwashed Honestly Im so triggered every time someone says tries to convince me that my country is this awful hellhole and we should GTFO or try to make it better We havent been around very long but were changing at a More faster pace than any of yalls countries are considering our extremely conservative origins so I honestly think were not doing too badly I dont think my beliefs were influenced by propaganda so either kindly STFU or GTFO
I hate when I have to talk about NYUAD to other people When they ask if Ive been on every continent my answer is yes and I feel shame Also I hate myself for even writing this this is the most fucking privileged first world problem Ive ever heard It has been wonderful to get the opportunity to travel so much something that no one in More my family has the ability to do I have learned and experienced so much and I have a far more open and thoughtful mind than I would otherwise have But now Im questioning has it really been worth it I cant talk about this huge significant part of my life without feeling like a piece of shit and if I dont talk about it I feel like Im hiding More
I really dont understand how we have had names such as Mike Pompeo Bill Clinton Tony Blair etc visit NYUAD but we havent had internationally renowned journalist Gloria Borger To be honest seems like a disservice to me I would much rather she speak at graduation than at least half of the other speakers and I think her unique take on international events is something that could really add to the discussion at NYUAD

How do you deal with professors who are dismissive but only towards certain students not you By dismissive I mean my professor would often interrupt this girl in my class midsentence refuse to take questions from her and always have something to say against her opinions despite the fact they seem to reflect the classs take on the issue

Note from admin Happy holidays guys Confessions wishes you a happy and restful break ❤️
Exam anxiety is the most real thing I have ever had to deal with and yet people do not understand how much this impacts both my academia and my mental health On average during the semester I would usually have an A or A average for all my courses and then a final exam or test comes my way and suddenly my grades would drop from As and More As to Bs and Cs Its very disheartening and demotivating to deal with blows to my grades because of 1 exam that weighs 40 of my final grade The problem usually is not whether I have studied enough or not because I feel like I know the material to these subjects by heart at this point but end up doing bad on tests because I keep getting More
Last semester was such a disappointment in terms of classes All my professors were disorganized and did not care Classes had no structure and examspapers had nothing to do with lectures Seeing my professors not putting any effort killed my motivation to work In short I learnt nothing
I keep barely passing all my classes that count toward my major requirement I love my major I really do But I dont think I can do this in the future if Im this bad at it How do I have a future if I get C all the time How am I going to do anything if all I worry about it is whether or not I will pass this class How will I ever prove More that I am a better person than a C if thats the first thing people see in my transcript I know I should have worked harder done better but really I cried most of the days this semester because I was barely handling all the things that were on my plate At then end of the day Im just making excuses for what I did I dont even know why Im submitting this to confessions I have no idea why the school accepted me in the first place and Im pretty sure it was a mistake I wanted to do good things for this world As idealistic and dumb it sounds I wanted to make this world a better place doing what I loved I dont think I can do that anymore I am so tired

Overheard at D2 smells worksheet This worksheet smells so nice This is what my professor smells like smells worksheet again
Its actually annoying how people in Arts and Humanities constantly try to prove that their majors are as hard and challenging as STEM majors Yall struggle but your worst case scenario is like getting a C in a paper while people in STEM in NYUAD are constantly worried about passing their courses although they spend all their days More studying A lab in fos is worth 2 credits and sometimes less and you need to spend 16 credits worth of time to do all your assignments for lab Lets not even mention how lenient professors in almost all departments but STEM You miss a deadline youre dead and you dont even bother explaining to your professors because they wont listen or accept your late assignment And btw Im not trying to prove that one major is more important than the other but its unfair how easy it is for nonSTEM students to get good grades and have high GPAs while we struggle to get that C
Someone has to say it I am a GIRL and I HATE this hook upmake out culture I do not like absolutely every concept linked to it It drives me crazy to see girls allowing thirsty guys to use their body Why do you give you beautiful feminine energy love and passion to them why do you open up to someone who wont care about you Its so More freaking common for guys on campus to not even acknowledge girls existence afterward Why Because once your 10 minutes hook up is over youre just another done right swipe hopefully wellcooked at least and a new tick on his list of wonderful college experience Congratulations Now it is likely he will tell his friends how he hooked up with you and that girl that sits over the next table in the library I know it might be very hard to live without hooking up but please let us stop this hoeing games ON CAMPUS I dont want every guy I meet here ultimately think Im down for no strings attached thing just because I live amongst the majority who does it

Today is my birthday and while I appreciate and am endlessly grateful for the people who wished me and spent time with me I did expect some more attention on the one day in my year that kinda want it I understand that its finals and I usually dont expect anything out of people but it still sucks sitting here and scrolling through posts More of other peoples birthdays and how their friends bought them cake and threw them surprise parties and all and being saddened by the fact that no one cared enough to do that for me even thought Ive done that for others so many times Im too old to care about birthdays and I know that there are other things that show how much people care better than this but I still cant help but feel sad

The Christmas Tree in the D2 Entrance is as poorly decorated as the food variety available In D2 itself Its like a symbolic representation of what were supposed to expect when getting food Dont get me wrong and dont tell me take it or leave it the point Im trying to make is that we have same options for food every few days four More weeks a month four months per semester and four academic years in total As someone who respects ADNH and the Dining Committee this fault falls on ADNH because I know how hard people involved in the committee are trying their best to address our issues and improve the situation Happy Holidays xoxo
I am a guy and I have long wanted to talk about how candidly people talk about freely cheating on their significant half on this campus How it is just about physical contact and have 0 respect for their long distance relationship I want yall to know that Ive got a damn good girl half way accross globe and sometimes its a real stress More buster to have someone outside the nyuad circle because I can vent about this campus and not have to worry about it travelling back lol She has total and complete trust in me and I absolutely thrive off it and what Im trying to say ladies and gents on this campus is that it is cool to actually be faithful and respectful to your partner It is not being pussy whipped as some may term it Honestly some of my fellow dudes who brag about numbers and their conquests on campus Are appalling How did your mam raise you man And yes ladies faithful guys like us do in fact exist

REACH is honestly such a joke Aside from The Nook what even do you guys do Like I care about mental health and stuff too but the ineffectiveness of this group just surprises me And its annoying how much praise they get on this campus when I personally dont even feel remotely impacted by whatever work they do A dialogue isnt the More solution to everything and is getting people a couple dogs to play with really all you have to do to be loved by this community Youll be hearing from my anonymous feedback submission so dont bother commenting about it here

TRIGGER WARNING EATING DISORDERS Its honestly so annoying how they have been treating eating disorders here Weve been told to wait until the nutritionist comes on campus for the past 4 months every time they tell us that she will be here soon and now they arent sure she can come at all Do they realize how harmful that is to have an More eating disorder left untreated If the nutrionist cant come they need to provide other outlets for help rather than just telling us to wait for someone who might not even come What happens when eating disorders get so bad that we cant wait anymore
People on this campus have been so shitty to me about my weight As openminded as we all preach to be but the number of days where I get a shitty comment made about my weight says otherwise And not just about me but the amount of shit I hear about other girls weight too

I dont know anymore if it is that I just keep pushing my limits every semester beyond what I can handle or if have been becoming less and less able to handle my workload and sanity as the years go by Im currently in New York and I feel my environment here has only made everything more difficult Im struggling with my academics my More relationship figuring out my future I have to keep postponing tasks from my part time job and I dont feel I have time to myself anymore Now finals are coming and for the first time I am panicking in the most real and literal sense And somehow I feel if I went back in time to my first semester I would have the energy and passion I now lack and I would breeze through all this I know only I can change my situation but I dont know how Ive tried talking endlessly with the people closest to me but it hasnt helped With counselors its always a different person and I just feel I have to tell the same story over and over again and get no really useful advice I really want to get my sht together

Capstone is the biggest bullshit ever some students put so much effort because their professors require them to produce PhD work while others are chilling and do the minimum amount of work because their professors dont really care and in the end those who worked hard get B and C and those who basically didnt do anything get A Well this is really unfair I didnt want to post this on forum for privacy issues but I feel this should be addressed so that we together can find ways for resolving it

Starting my study away application earlier thinking about it before this weekend or even glancing at the questions before today could have made this long weekend really enjoyable But here I am trying to come up with 4 other factors that contributed to my global education for the past 35 minutes
I want to be organizing activities I want to be part of StuGov and help shape this place I want to be part of the group improving NYUAD every day But I am afraid I am not the person for that I get tired very quickly from social situations and organizing events or any kind of activities even meetings would consume too much of my energy I More would need a lot more rest after that cutting down my study time even more and I am afraid affecting how well I do in school I am constantly drawn between these two wishes wanting to make a difference but also wanting a comfortable environment and good grades Anyone in a similar situation
This may be repetitive but the left leaning people here can be quite a nuisance You voice one conservative and even completely different opinion and they all think youre a criminal and synonymous with Hitler What happened to multiple perspective discussions
Love in the times of UNIX lab
Can someone explain to me why anyone thought that putting a black person and kfc together in a cartoon was a good idea Maybe it was not intentionally racist but all it does is reinforce our biases and subtle assumptions of the attributes of certain races We can do better global leaders
I give NYUAD four more years of existence five at most before NYU pulls out and it becomes American University of Abu Dhabi
Overheard on the Highline I couldnt sleep at all last night Oh is that because you take 62 depression naps a day
 NYUAD Students Please better investigate sexual assault allegations Administration Uhm yeah sure One student Putting a black person and KFC in the same frame is racist Admin omg youre right gazelle takE DOWN THE CARTOON
Fighting over standardized testing scores on freshman is the most idiotic thing I can think of right now These tests are so not accurate at all ACTs and SATs are sometimes completely new to nonus applicants and unless you attended a rich high school you probably never heard of them What does it really measure anyway I know people who More have done AMAZING things on their fields and didnt get stellar ACTSAT scores and I am talking about 25s and 1250s VS Actual publications amazing research and unimaginable university programs But what do they have Dedication integrity passion and curiosity It really makes me mad that people on campus argue about how the University level More
I do not think it is safe to be at the university especially with all the sexual harassment going around If I write more my identity will be revealed thats why we need to stop the nonsense happening at my building Loud parties too many drinks then its not even safe to be out of your room at night
At this point I wont be surprised if D2 comes up with this new soup called Cream of Table
Dating someone at uni is nice and all until you realise you know the people they hang around with and have to do your best to be nice when you see them and you see them often enough surprisingly but youll shiv a bitch that gets within a 2 metre radius of your significant other tbh
Whoever wrote that STEM vs humanities article you cant compare two majors as a whole Compare aspects of it like CASE 1 Time in class While 80 of humanities majors sit in 25 hours of class for 4 credits 80 of STEM majors have 5 hours of class Labs for the same 4 credits This does make life harder for STEM majors as they dont More have AS MUCH time to commit to things they like or are passionate about No one said humanities is lesser we just say STEM takes up more of your time 
CASE 2 Number of requirements STEM tends to have way more example SRPP 14 biology 17 engineering 21 Imagine this coupled with the extra hours of class 
Case 3 Readings STEM does More
Dear crush if you wont ask me out soon I will block your account and forget your name Its been almost a semester of pointless messenger communication intense eye contact and you popping up in places where I usually go to Boy if youre too shy to really approach me I aint got no time for stressing over you in the upcoming finals week So think twice Please
Everyone talks about how difficult it is to be an average student here but what about being told your whole life that youre so tall only to find out that your height is pretty average
NYUAD is ruining my life one email at a time and I dont even go to this uni dont me
To whoever wrote the FYD article on the Gazelle please know that its the most inconsiderate and biased thing Ive ever read on that website When you write an article you should be aware of what other people think about that issue and who it is going to affect after being published Despite the fact that there are people who are not a More big fan of FYD there are also people who think its one of the best programs NYUAD has ever designed Labeling something that numerous people worked on to give students a smooth transition as artificial is very maddening Unlike some of you there are people including myself who actually enjoyed their FYD and met their true friends there FYRCE My FYDs peer facilitator and Fellow FYDers I love you all
I had a really bad experience last year with an RA that left me feeling unsafe in my own dorm building It took a huge toll on my mental health and it prevented me from getting proper sleep because I didnt feel safe or comfortable I didnt feel like I could tell anyone because I was scared of retaliation and everyone else thought this RA could do no wrong Now Im scared that Ill have to deal with the same thing when I return to campus next semester and I dont know what to do
Before coming to uni I felt average af and I was totally okay with that I didnt come to NYUAD to become the next global leader or idk Oprah HOWEVER NOW we have a problem a few months have passed and im feeling very below average Idk man I just want to sleep like 258 but im counting my blessings so its fine I guess
Sometimes I really wish that we could all forget that we are students and enjoy the process of learning something new It sucks that assignments and projects take the joy out of learning in some classes
I am a student currently on a leave of absence I have been struggling with bulimia for 3 months now I have not mustered the courage to have this talk with my family yet and I am having a hard time coping with it on my own I really dont fancy dying of a torn esophagus so I would really appreciate any kind of help from anyone who has been in this position at some point Thanks and lots of love ❤
Its so fucked up that most people here attend events only because of the free food Its so disheartening to put so much effort into planning events coordinating people booking rooms fixing technical issues and so many other things only to have people come for 10 minutes grab food and leave I mean good food is a plus for sure but arent student events supposed to be all about interest But alas even for that people here are so shallow smh
Still quite triggered about the class of 2021 tshirt and how it is absolutely not abayafriendly lol
Can someone remind me of the purpose of ROR Cause recently it has been flushed with a tons of tickets selling and other sales stuffs that have nothing to do with the university Why dont we have a dedicated group for just these kinds of sales advertisement The thing about having too much of these sales stuffs is that they just displace other announcements and stuffs that are actually related to the university
It has been one day since Confessions posted 3267 my post Its true that I should have been straight forward but the person I intended to see it did and they didnt mention it but I could tell the way they acted changed for the better I hope every person who asked is this about me treated the person they are with better if you love More them or were honest with them if there are certain things you need to talk about that you have been putting off Maybe this should be on crushes and compliments but thanks to the confessions page for making things that much better by providing a platform to say things that are sometimes too scary to say
Help What do you do to the suitemate that constantly leaves their dirty dishes on the counter eats her suitemates food without asking overloads the fridge with strong smelling food and never throws their food away even after they are rotten leaves a huge mess in the bathroom and expects her suitmates to just clean everything after them How do we surprise them with the fact that we are only their suitemates and not their nannies
Just because there are Emiratis who date nonemiratis in this campus Doesnt mean all Emiratis would want to date nonemiratis This is not racism and I am sick of people telling me Oh we feel sorry for you you do not have the freedom to love anyone It is my preference to marry someone who has the same culture religion and ethnic background as me I want to raise my kids in this country I will accept if my kids would want to marry nonemiratis but I dont want to marry a nonemiratis
Someone used to love me very much I still love them very much I know they will read this here and Im too scared of the answer to ask them this outright 
I dont think its the same for you anymore Not the way you talk to me not the way you hold my hand or even look at me You dont call me when Im away like you used to The late More nights when I felt down and broken and you could feel it and your voice made it all better You told me a few weeks ago you didnt want it the way it was anymore When you said that I thought you meant the bad but you meant all of it I dont get the anger from you anymore but I dont get the love either I thought you were trying to keep yourself from getting too close but I think youre trying to be close in a way you dont feel anymore I love you the same way I did the first November If you dont feel the same way anymore just tell me I wont want to hear it but I tried to love someone after I didnt love them anymore remember It didnt work
I am conducting a research on educational opportunities privileges by nationality and income level Does anyone know how I can find NYUAD acceptance rate for Emirati students Too scared people might call me a racist if I ask this publicly
Im falling for her and she is leaving for NY in the spring What do I do
I believe there should be more events for seniors in more exciting locations than Torch Club Common guys who organize this step up your game So far so sad
This campus feels so fuckin small when you constantly bump into your ex your exs ex your roommates ex and your exs roommatesfriends
NYUAD life is living with all your friends on a 1km wide desert island campus and still managing to not see each other for 3 days straight because everyones busy all the time
Dont know if this is the appropriate place to post this but I hate to post under my own name so here goes Can people with flashing fairy lights in their room please close their curtains I was still feeling the effects of a killer migraine and the flashing was not helping the least bit Sorry if this sounds stupid or petty its such a small thing but it got to me
 NYUAD student NYUAD has anything that you may want when looking for a university NonNYUAD student What about freedom of speech
Why cant I read critical comments on 3244 Is it just me or no one cant read it Was it filtered by the admin
Overheard on the Highline I always undress without closing my curtains I dont care for anyone who sees me its like saying Merry Christmas
Is it normal to feel lazy or unmotivated to do your work even though its stuff you generally loveenjoy doing
Just wanted to point out that the treatment of the fish in the CDC is absolutely barbaric At least two of the poor dears were stuck in the filter someone let in a beta fish with the rest of them and several were mourning their friend in a corner 
If theyre committed to keep such a massive and quite frankly pointless aquarium could More they at least read up on how to take care of it Or get rid of it altogether At this point with the amount of misery swimming there the fish would feel happier back at the pet shop
Please have some humanity
Can we lowkey make knowing peoples names those who you havent met normal I know a lot of peoples names bc I remember them from CW Marhaba or social media and I keep forgetting that some people might remember and life is just plain awkward
Overheard at the East Plaza Are we biologically wired to like babies so that we dont eat them
The only thing thats harder than fos is turning off the light in classrooms
People who hold doors open for other people you have my love 
What exactly happens if you tell the counselor here that youre suicidal It sucks because when you are you cant talk to anyone about it and if you talk about it to your counselor then theyll have to report it and admin and the government dont take that kind of thing lightly read send you home for the semester so you can commit suicide away from them
I have a bit of a moral dilemma and am reaching in case anyone has experience with this My boyfriend and I have been together for around 4 years now were both seniors and he is perfect in every way imaginable but he has had some problems which were and still are out of my control such as mental health issues which I cant disclose here More and other severe health issues for the past two years problems that I can honestly no longer emotionally handle Its so draining to me that I feel that I should rather end it because I cant be there for him and focus on uni because I am anyways no help and we will not be together next year But I do love him and cant continue seeing him hurt What should I do
I cant believe the senior class has to pay for our own graduation robes this year That shit is expensive budgetcuts
Im reaching out through this post because I need some advice My boyfriend and I have gotten together in freshman year and have stayed together till now our senior year He is perfect in every regard and has always been therefore me and I love him a lot But in the last two years he became both physically and as a collateral damage also More mentally ill As I said I love him a lot but I just dont know how to be there for him anymore Im just done I cant balance my senior year and being there properly That makes me think its unfair to him and I want to break up but then again I dont want to just leave him in this state Im helpless
Why Russian and Caribbeanthemed days in the Meal Club They are sooo disgusting Why not Thai Korean Spanish or even German instead These are nice cuisines that everyone likes
I find it harder and harder to balance the time I spend taking care of myself and the time I spend taking care of others This semester has been difficult for me and I feel stuck between not wanting to tell people Im miserable because thats mine to decide to share and I just dont want to and responding to people who need emotional More support Im in a place right now where I just dont care and any empathetic response I have to muster is forced and fake I think these people deserve better than what I can give them right now I also think its unfair for someone to demand emotional support from me if I have never required it of them and have been there for them several times But I also feel really guilty and shitty I really wish I could be there for people more I just dont know how to anymore
Is wanting to be there for myself more than wanting to be there for other people who Im not really close to either so bad If it is and Im willing to accept it is how do I support people while supporting myself without feeling anxious and overwhelmed Am I just selfish
How do I make friends who dont make use of me Im not white I dont look good and in fact I probably look very intimidating despite being a nice person Im always ready to help anyone in need and I always always go out of my way too but sometimes I just need someone or some people to be around me I dont need them to help me with More anything but I just would appreciate their company which would mean a lot to me Kind of tired of being misunderstood by everyone including in class its not my fault that Im smart Im not trying to be and in no way do I try to show off or make anybody else feel small and Im very careful about that Of course I come from a different culture and I More
I have never understood how you can be called a racist if you criticize Islam Islam is a religion and a religion is a belief system It has nothing to do with race You dont choose to be black or white however you do choose which religion you subscribe to Its a choice you make and a choice you will be held responsible for Its not racist to criticize a religion built on injustice and patriarchal structures its common sense
How can you call NYUAD diverse when everyone in the student body went to a high school 
I think NYUAD as a whole could benefit if some of the discussions on here were picked up and continued constructively and respectfully elsewhere Some posts hit on some really important issues about the existence of NYUAD in the UAE but unfortunately their point and their merit is buried in anything from convoluted anecdotes to outright More bigotry and I think were really missing out on an opportunity to discuss important issues that a university must address as frankly and openly as possible with obvious limitations and the understanding that some information will probably never be disclosed publicly like agreements between the government and the university what was discussed More
FRIENDS I have been at this uni for YEARS and I still cant find the perfect combo to make a wrap in GrabnGo Would love it if people posted their personal recipes
I feel like the university is increasingly admitting more and more cats as the years go by and they make up 69 of the mamallian resident body the majority I understand that this is their country of origin and we wouldnt be saying anything However if the idea of this university is to be biodiverse I think increasing the cat intake More isnt a good thing I know for a fact that most of them eat scraps of posh D2 food when noone is looking and live in pretty comfortable bushes which doesnt really add to the diversity of experiences at this school I know cockroaches that have survived pesticide epidemics geckos whove created infrastructures for addressing problems in their More
please read the whole thing 3 Do people actually fail classes at this university I am a frshman and I feel as though Im the worst at this campus I was a major overachiever all my life but it came at the cost of anxiety depression and an eating disorder that combined with family related events left me broken by the end of highschool I More am learning to prioritize my mental health I no longer pull off all nighters prioritize self care etc and I am still healing from things which means I need to take things really slow but still putting my best effort into academics within whats reasonable and all things considered I am the happiest I have been in years and I am determined to More
As a graduate from NYUAD I understand how difficult it can be to maintain relationships because of the workload and study aways but trust me if you really like someone go for them and everything else will work itself out My favorite memories at NYUAD was when I was studying with my girlfriend and we were supporting each other with our More individual goals and dreams So guys and girls I can say with confidence dont let academics get in the way of your feelings for someone your university life shouldnt only be about academics its about the people you meet and the relationships you make
Overheard at the Baraha I want to eat Korean food Whats stopping you Mmm my bank account
Believe all women means that any female student can falsely accuse me of rape and ruin my future
Can we actually stop posting photos of peoples lost ID I mean appreciate all the effort and kindness but a simple tag or mentioning of the name would do Its a small campus and people are incredibly easy to locate Please just be considerate that some people might not feel comfortable with such a post
Overheard D2 Maybe hes from British You know how the Indians colonized British
Overheard on the Highline I am considering becoming religious I will follow whichever God will help me write my capstone
Ive been struggling a lot with selfcompassion and vulnerability lately Before the fall semester began I decided to make the conscious effort to prioritize my mental health because I realized how much I neglected it the previous year It was so easy to bury my emotions because of the workcommitments I had I feel like I have made More progress in some ways and for that I am very happy but now I feel very stuck and I dont know how to move forward
One aspect in particular is that I am unable to let people that I am gay The first people I ever came out to were my parents and they didnt take it very well I was 16 at the time and both sides said some pretty mean things I was scared More
Maybe its just me but its quite saddening to see class of 2022s standardized test scores drop significantly from those of the previous cohorts If NYUAD is lowering admissions standards to increase diversity and student body size now what will it become 3 5 or 10 years later No offense at all to the freshmen in fact a big welcome to you all but as a member of this magnificent institution and community Im genuinely concerned whether it can withstand the challenge of time
Anyone else concerned that the university is becoming less selective Every other university saw an increase in selectivity and test scores in the 2017 cycle but median SAT scores at NYUAD have fallen from 1510 to 1440 Meritocracy is is becoming less important perhaps due to an increased emphasis on diversity
NYUAD students be like
I feel like the university is increasingly admitting more and more Emiratis as the years go by and they make up 15 of the student body the majority I understand that this is their country of origin and we wouldnt be saying anything about too many Americans being accepted at an American institution However if the idea of this More university is to be diverse I think increasing the Emirati intake isnt a good thing I know for a fact that most of them attended posh international schools and come from a pretty comfortable background which doesnt really add to the diversity of experiences at this school I know people who have survived war zones people whove created startups for More
NYUAD students Can I breathe ResEd Breathing will result in a fee of 100 USD per Applications
Its really concerning that we only have one fulltime counsellor in the Health and Wellness Center I tried to make an appointment today because I was having a rough time and the only free appointment More slots are in seven days time Im aware of the recent Gazelle article that addressed this issue but isnt it problematic that a similar article was published in 2014 httpswwwthegazelleorgissue45newshealthandwellness Both times the issue was the licensing process Considering that its been four years since this problem first arose one would assume that university learned how to deal with it I greatly appreciate the effort made by Reach and other student support groups however these programs do not work for everyone since some of us prefer to meet with a counsellor I feel powerless because I do not know what we as students could do to push this forward
My mentalphysical health is in the shitter by this point but I dont know how to bring it up with people I feel like my friends know but never ask me about it for whatever reason I also feel like my professors shouldnt know about it but at the same time they expect certain resultsupdates about my capstone and Im simply not able to deliver so they end up thinking I dont care
Global leaders ™ be like
Its funny how nobody called out John Sexton for explicitly saying in his talk yesterday that this goes for both genders implying that there are only two genders and similar things like Gentlemen they women are just better than us implying that gender is binary but if literally anyone else on campus says something like that they get ostracized and pillared by the social justice warriors Just goes to show our hypocrisy or the shallowness of our convictions
The penalty for missing the consent zone training is literally worse than for actually assaulting someone on campus lolol
I came here eager for meaningful conversations and understanding the world a little bit better But somehow we all have managed to fall into our daily life routines caring about food and parties and complaining about homework forgetting the bigger picture with discussions popping out rarely here and there from time to time If we the best More of the best behave so carelessly so ordinary and so nonselfcritically how can we ever believe that the world can be a better place And is it even worth it going out of our own comfort zones why and who do we make a better place for
Thank you for your kind comments on my post 3314 Update my girlfriend said yes and I cant believe it I can now call the beautiful girl I talked to in the NYUAD dining hall three years ago my fiancée and it feels crazy knowing that I almost didnt approach her because I was so nervous I hope all of you can experience the current love and happiness I have at the moment the men of nyuad dont assume a girl youve never spoken to is uninterestedinterested in you take a chance ask talk to her
Advice to current students from an alumnus please dont be afraid to talk to the girl you like even one youve never even spoken to before I did and now weve been together for three years I am going to propose to her tonight

Ive been having hyperpigmentation problems since high school leading to darker spotsmarks in some parts of my body like in my armpits Ive been using skin whitening creams like the one mentioned in NYUAD Forum since freshman year A while ago I made a request to the Convenience Store and I was so thankful that they made the product More available Im sorry if my request made people uncomfortable that wasnt my intention Overall I find our community very supportive but it makes me feel sad when people assume things Context matters
Overhead at D2 Ive been to more consent trainings than Ive had sex on this campus
I feel extremely sad about The Gazelles recent article about ethnic cliques and heres why 
I come from a place where it takes a huge effort to learn about other cultures because nearly everybody is local Its not easy for us to travel abroad and not many immigrants come either And reading travel blogs or watching documentaries on More YouTube cant possibly be compared to making new friends in person Witnessing all their emotions as they tell you about their countries and customs having them teach you random phrases in their languages sharing your favorite songs from home with each other Think of it in economic terms if you will This knowledge is a precious resource that one More
I was going to write a Why NYU Abu Dhabi Shouldnt Exist in response to Why NYU Tel Aviv Shouldnt Exist but then realized there isnt enough political freedom and expression in the country to be able to do so
The recent Gazelle article on NYU Tel Aviv truly stunned me I am by no means a supporter of Israel but advocating for the invalidation of the global site located there is both hypocritical and counterproductive There is no denying that Israel in more ways than one has subjugated the Palestinian people but several questions arise from More the articles proposal By what metric does Israel stand out as one of the most extreme cases of human rights abusers amongst the countries hosting NYU global sites Does NYUs presence within a country serve as an endorsement for that countrys actions Would the closure of NYU Tel Aviv remedy the situation in any way As the author pointed More
Im frankly done with white men whining about the potential exclusion of their kind and functioning under the naive assumption that every race gender and class around them is treated equally and functioning under this assumption because we go to a supposedly diverse university
Yes John Sexton and Al Bloom brought this school to life More and gave it so much progress and I am beyond grateful I am an NYUAD student now because of them But lets not forget that people in power and statures of authority are and should be representative of those they lead and in this search for a new Vice Chancellor it is opportune time to do that The search for a new more representative and diverse leader doesnt and shouldnt undermine the work of Sexton and Bloom but should push it forward in a way that achieves the world they are trying to create a diverse and representative one
Plot twist the dissonance post was written by Sexton Or Bloom as his honest goodbye speech Or a girl on drugs in NYC Who knows
I am a recent grad and currently looking for jobs I have realized a few things that I wish I had realized sooner in my senior year so I am publishing this in hopes that it helps someone right now
1 Starting off with your resume please get it reviewed by multiple people I made the mistake of just sticking to a couple of people in More addition to visiting the Career Centre I dont think there is anything wrong with the career centres help but it always helps to get it reviewed 
2 If you are serious about consulting jobs please start preparing for case interviews early If you wait till you get an interview call it will be too late and youll end up passing on a great opportunity More
I am currently spending my semester abroad at NYUAD and I noticed one amazing thing that isnt as common in NYU campus in New York surprisingly the amount of interracial couples I think it is so special to see how different cultures can integrate together and form relationships Your college years at NYUAD are extremely unique Treasure them form relationships explore do not take them for granted
Opinion The Rise and Fall of NYUAD Dissonance
As Im sitting here in my apartment in NYC waiting for my food to arrive I decided to write this little text to all the past current and future NYUAD citizens be it a student faculty or admin While I decide to remain anonymous I am an alumna of NYUAD who was there when the fancy More campus didnt exist and NYUAD felt more like a summer camp of a few hundred people rather than a small liberal university in the few thousands Back in the day Sexton was our leader in flesh and blood and in NYUAD rather than the contemporary acrosstheocean ideological messiah

I love that the WiFi has been exceedingly worse than any semester before and yet students arent complaining about it because were too busy fighting for properly working dining halls
Can you guys fucking understand that youre in the UAE and theres supposed to be some respect for the culture in your clothing You knew that coming here dont start crap about freedom and your body autonomy If you had half a brain you would at least put a shirt on and stop walking around with your entire body exposed or better yet in a place that prohibits it
Overheard at NYUAD You know I dont judge people Well I just judged her really hard but apart from that I dont judge people
There are so many freshmen walking about with hickeys ah young love Good times

Welcome to your first Thursday night class of 2022

Res Ed is so bad at their job theyre worse than the Egyptian Government
I have to confess that of all the places in time and around the world I could be right now this moment at NYUAD is better than average
rom admin Welcome back to campus guys
The intensity of the facebook discussions and the passiveaggressiveness between students is concerning for someone coming back to campus in a week We are the most diverse student body in the world Do you expect that we would agree on everything When arguing with someone please consider their religious cultural ethnic background and More personal experience See where other people are coming from Do not lose others because you disagree on some social issues This is a university a place for a free flow of ideas not an indoctrination camp where only one way of thought is dominant
Whats with alums being so involved in oncampus debates We appreciate the occasional word of advice but shouldnt you have something better to do with your time than baitinstigate If this is what life after NYUAD looks like then Im concerned
The greatest curse of being a global leader is finding the perfect fellowshipinternshipjob that fits your dreams and qualifications only to realize the position is only open to American citizens
Lol ResEd just outdoes their own stupidity every time Im no hard core sustainability advocate but who in their right mind throws away hangers that are in perfect condition just to stick to their socalled policies Ive never seen a more inefficient department and I come from a developing country That says something

This page is one of the top results when I search on Facebook NYUAD Im in my last year of senior school and I dont want to apply here any more if it is like you say it is
Ive seen a lot of people talk about feeling alone and depressed on campus and just needing someone to talk to I know this isnt the most conventional way to do this but at least it would be somewhere for people to see 
Comment if it is okay for anyone to message you even if they dont know you orand regardless of their relationship More with you if they feel like they need someone to talk to 
Please only do so if you are absolutely sincere and really willing to do so I t is also absolutely okay not to feel like you can Lets spread some love 
Some of the upperclassmen that I have spoken to have been really fake when it comes to helping out They comment on my ROR posts willing to help but when I PM them they ignore my messages or give me halfassedinaccurate information They only comment because they want their peers to see and think theyre kind and helpful but deep down there is so much ugly competitiveness arrogance and snobbiness Thank you to the upperclassmen who are genuine when it comes to offering help you know who you are
When I read some confessions which fall more under the category of rantargument I wish there were a way for a confession to be reviewed by copy editors They are just structured and written like trash While some believe that people should move from the veil of anonymity ie confessions to more formal mediums for the sake of openness and transparency I think we should do so so that peoples ideas and arguments are structured and coherent
I dont want to go back I dont want to walk the same highline as someone who I know to be a sexual harasser as someone who I know to be a sexual assaulter etc I agree I am not the victim but I would lie if I said I dont shake a little when I see them How long are these people gonna be covered for
Do people get offended when people wear clothing that isnt from their culture Or soccer jerseys from countries other than their own In a manner that is out of love and respect not out of a desire to mock the culturecountry Heart react Im fine with it I dont get offended as long as the person is not mocking the place Angry react I think people should only wear clothing that belongs to their culture and soccer jerseys from their country
Ive read an older article about the disappoint level students experience after they graduate from NYUAD I know the situation has improved with lots of students getting into really good grad schools and some getting good jobs Nowadays entering the industry is very competitive in addition to the fact that many students from our school More apply for the same jobs as the rare number of entrylevel jobs available out there I might be mistaken for this sentence and fact but its what Ive observed in the past 23 years Im a rising senior and have researched potential jobs though a lot of them ask for 23 years of experience how do we get that experience when we can do limited More
Im an incoming freshman and I dont think Ill make any friends at nyuad Whenever I talk on the group chat people ignore me or reply quite rudely I dont think anyone shares the same interests as me and no one in my class has really made an effort to reply to me I got bullied really badly in high school and I guess the cycle of me being the outsider is going to repeat itself My anxiety has worsened because of this and I dont know how Im going to cope once I arrive on campus
Being a student from the US the biggest reason Im excited to get back to campus is that I dont have to worry about making akward eye contact through the gaps in bathroom stalls
Lets face it Despite NYUADs diversity there is some intense selfsegregation that occurs in this school Races barely mix often to a stark and dismal extent And everyone hides under their excuse of we need to seek some familiarity in a place that is so different from our homes Global leaders this is not the school we signed up for More But that is sadly a reality that colors or doesnt for the white kids who stay with their white counterparts although in no way do I want to shame them the colored individuals are just as bad if not miles worse the university

Lol at politically conservative kids acting like the school is a intolerant and dangerous place for them to express views claiming time and time again this unistudent body has proven that only certain views are tolerated What incidents have there actually been Like the whole post anonymously on confession about representation is necessary because the student body is oh so harmful Just sounds like hiding behind the fear of not being able to argue your case well enough
firstworldproblems NYUAD edition Being upset that your country is 3 hours away because your friends who live far away earn more air miles
I came from a place where I had nothing Earning money for food was challenging and I would sleep to fight my hunger I worked hard got the grades and made it to nyuad and I am so grateful Im grateful to the UAE and its rulers for giving me a better life Now I am guaranteed a meal on my plate The lack of financial burden has made it More easier for my family to live and I am educating myself in the process This is the most generous place in the world with the kindest local and expatriate community I am happy to be here and I remind myself of that everyday This is why I hate seeing negative stereotypes about Arabs in the media and Emiratis in patricular on this group because they are nothing but biased and untrue I love everything about the NYUAD and the UAE and it is an honor to be living here
This is not a post about mental health and WHERE to find help This is a post raising a question HOW one should go about getting help feeling safe and comfortable Ive been struggling emotionally for the last few years The case intensified once I moved to university with the additional weight of academic stress isolation and lack More personal space to be openly sad while sharing a double on Saadiyat bubble NYUAD offers plenty of resources for emotional wellbeing that I am aware of and thankful for I am slowly working on myself 💪🏻 but sometimes I still need to talk it out you know However due to the very deep personal nature of my issues I simply do not feel comfortable More
I see you guys prying on freshman girls Adding people on Facebook and all How bout you get to know them first
Im so nervous about the marhaba math placement test Its making me feel so depressed because my major depends on a high placement
Dear freshmen and nonfreshmen As you venture throughout your studies at NYUAD you will most likely intensify your frequency and maybe even depth of interactions with fellow humans to a level unprecedented by your earlier life stages Be openminded and let people in It will be wonderful Also know that here the walls of privacy are thin More and bumping into visible reminders of lost opportunities hurt and heartbreak occur at a throbbing rate on these small patches of Island home As you attach and detach from people I hope for the sake of your sanity you remember the following A person who values you would not put themselves in a position to lose you If they do and you have the More
I really dont know what to do Im an incoming freshmen and our rooming assignments leaked for a few minutes and I found out that I was put in the same room as my high school bully They made my high school experience hell and Im so scared to be sharing a room with them Can anyone help me please
Im so tired of people associating a specific age with a class Freshmen can be within the age range of 1620 years old and Seniors can be around 2024 years old give or take Not all freshmen are underage minors Idk just something to think about
What counts as sexual harassment at nyuad dont give me the anything the victim felt uncomfortable with bullcrap shouldnt one have some standards before labeling someone a harasser and dont give me the toxic masculinity bullshit I identify as sheher
If the admins for Confessions and CC have an anonymous gorilla suit wrestling match Id pay a semesters worth of dining dirhams to go see that
Suddenly I remembered that my sexual harasser is going to be back on campus in the fall Suddenly I am not so excited about going back to school I was excited about the classes Im taking and seeing my friends but now Im just discouraged and dont know what to do PS I did report the incident
Theres really no need for everything to be constructively criticized on the forum sometimes you want to say something and not deal with the selfrighteous prickstheres nothing wrong with that and thats plainly the whole point of confessions
As a recent graduate seeing Tristans face on nyuadmarhabas story made me utterly happy and sadnyuad really is a special place ❤️
omg can we all stop with these underrepresentation posts listen i dont think admissions are sitting in their office and hand picking candidates and be like nah i dont like these African Americans were not taking them im pretty sure theres a reasoooonnnn just for every person that doesnt get into our uni from any other More country like grades or volunteering or whatever yall be fighting later that admissions are trying to diversify the campus and send offers to everyone but those who actually have worked super hard to get here also dont forget that our uni is also not the most popular in the world and people still have stereotypes about the Middle East when they think More
The reason why many people opt to post anonymously is simply because they have a confession that they think is worth bringing up but do not wish to deal with the aftermath Maybe their too busy to follow up or they dont want to deal with the negative criticism because they know that they might get stigmatised negatively in such a small More community Which brings me to my main point on why I sincerely despise individuals who comment on confessions being all high and mighty and politically correct Just get off your high horse and stop commenting because you think the comment will get you tons of likes since youre being politically correct Also man up when you made a mistake either More
Disclaimer I am not the author of the article referred to in 3254 As a member of another minority group that often gets shunned because we too are deemed sensationalist and selfindulgent when trying to highlight issues pertinent to our community this confession hits hard This is exactly why generally I refuse to speak about issues my More community systemically face unless Im either conversing with people who have similar experiences or people who are willing to listen rather than suggest my narrative lacks truth as soon as a part of it appears unsubstantial in this case whether he truly is first or not I want to applaud the author for his courage of stepping outside his More
Im sick of all these people expressing opinions regarding campus topics and issues through confessions Post on forum at least there we can all have meaningful debates and conversations Otherwise use this time to do something more productive over summer including to take a break
Friends and classmates Im genuinely baffled by the recent criticism of the Gazelle article on African American representation I understand that there was disagreement on the definition of African American however the author clarified his interpretation to be those descended from slaves and explained why it is an important distinction More Furthermore even if you do not consider the author the first African American male his point that there is a lack of representation remains valid especially given the large number of Americans admitted every year Our resistance to acknowledging the issue he brings up is almost as worrisome as the issue itself
Totally a fan of constructive criticism but like isnt this whole attacking The Gazelle thing a bit random They try their best to represent the voice and opinions of the student body it doesnt mean everything they publish is objectively correct The article being criticized is just ONE opinion among others Sincerely not a gazelle member
As an incoming freshman Im struggling with parental resistance to my inevitable departure Right now Im struggling to convince them that Ive made the right the decision that the opportunity Ive been afforded isnt particularly worthwhile or noteworthy that the education wont live up to the standards in my own country that my More prospects of getting jobs have been limited because of NYUADs lack of prestige and its relative newness I have my own objections to these points but my parents believe that I am blinded by novelty of it all Did anyone else face similar problems after they were accepted How did you deal with it
The gazelle article was dumb The inaugural class had 141 students who started college in 2010 Many races and nationalities were underrepresented because the old NYUAD campus was small and it was the universitys first year However NYUAD gave us a bigger campus and I am seeing greater representation so admissions are considering More representation significantly This school is one of the most diverse schools I have ever seen There are a variety of nationalities and ethnicities represented as opposed to only a few nationalities that dominate the student body Think about it this school couldve been exclusive to UAE high school students but they opened up their arms to all different types of people around the world Think about how the majority of universities in the US have less than 15 and LESS international students and these are old wellestablished institutions Think about how those institutions charge their international students double and fail to offer financial aid
The article made me genuinely curious how many african americans are on campus likecomment if you are 
LMFAO Crushes and Compliments refused to post my comment which points out that they take some posts down after a few hrsdays CrushesCompliments I like but I see what youre doing Lol
I recently got out of a conversation with my friends from back home about dorms I had literally nothing to say while they complained about how expensive dorms are or how hard they have to work to earn hall points to get housing the next year None of my friends have resources as good as the ones we get at NYUAD Ffs Our bathrooms are More comparable to a five star hotels bathroom 
So while this is not really a confession I think this is the opportune time with freshman less than a month away older kids missing NYUAD and sick of home and the marhabawelcome crew getting ready to head back to just put it out there that maybe we can start showing appreciation for NYUAD in smaller More
The First Black American Male Student at NYUAD enrolled as part of the Inaugural Class in 2010 and graduated in 2014 So did the first Black American Female Student This is in contradiction to the Gazelle article criticising the institution for admitting its first Black American male in 2017 Addressing race and accessibility is important More and there is an abundance of real accurate data to support effective action Sensationalism and selfindulgent comparisons to genuine civil rights leaders dont help the community Its not for the culture People need to know the truth to do the right thing and the school paper needs to fact check
I CANNOT get over how gorgeous Sheikh Hamdan is I follow him on instagram and each time he puts on another story I literally gasp And on top of physical perfection he is so kind and humble and generous Can we petition to have him as the commencement speaker please

After spending some years at NYUAD Ive come to understand what it is about this place and being here that often drives us crazy I have lost count of the number of times Ive heard people say that coming here has been great but theyve actually become less confident than what they used to be in high school After interacting with many More many people and having the deepest of introspections I have come to realize the following You cant be everything You can and should play another octave but you cant play every octave Find one or two things you like and enjoy doing and use the universitys resources to become better at it I know that people who are highly regarded here More

To the dear cutie that left a mint gum stuck to the bottom of a desk at E this Monday evening
My gratitude to you is ineffable You know before you happened to me I used to think that I was staggering from all the shit that fell on my shoulders How wrong I was Your frivolity with the gum took the wool off my eyes unveiling how More much free time I indeed have to go around campus in attempts to find a cleaning service just to finally hear that the fabric my pants were made from cannot be dry cleaned I used to think that the amount of my problems has reached the apogee apparently I still have some extra stress space left Now my pants with a sticky gum do not just symbolize my despair and distress they also act as an eternal idol of our newborn relationship You might think this was a sarcasm nay thingy vailed contempt but I will be honest this gum will firmly hold our mutual love till the very moment I find you and stick it into your throat in hopes of seeing you suffocating

NYUAD has the most number of whineyass students crying mental health problems at the smallest inconvenience Yeah college is hard classes are hard and youre never going to be the allrounder you were in high school Suck it up and deal with it Youre not depressed youre making yourself a victim Stop being such hypochondriac wusses and deal with life 
Typical NYUAD students 
A very Happy Holidays reminder that your break just started but its gonna end soon too

Still thinking of PhD after graduation 
honestly I just want to express how grateful I am for this man without him I would not be able to be so fortunate to go here bc no matter how you feel about nyuad you cannot deny how easy we have some stuff 
This is an appreciation post for all guy friends who dont want to hook up with their female friends You are great friends and Im sure that extends beyond your ability to befriend a gender you are attracted to and not proclaim your love to them Sometimes it takes someone telling you to leave your so for them because they love you More and were always there for you you know like a good friend for you to sit down and think about how grateful you are that not all of your guy friends want to sleep with you even though this asshole made you feel like that for a little while
Thanks to everyone who respects people Just in general Human decency 
I wish people wanted me as much as they want luggage scales and vacuum cleaners at the end of every semester 
To upperclassmen how do you deal with the winter break goodbyes especially to those you wont see until senior year 
it has only been one day but i already miss campus and the people who were there so very much i know we signed up knowing friends will be leaving all the time when we came here but i am really struggling anyway knowing that so many people who are the reason i love nyuad will be gone 
It might take a year It might take a day But whats meant to be will always find its way 
Ladies if he gets hard at inconvenient times makes you cry at least once a week keeps you from succeeding at your life plans constantly fucks you over Thats not your man Thats FoS 
I wish I could reenact scenes from shades of grey Like the one that she got the job right out of college 
just want to appreciate everyone who isnt ecstatic about going home for winter break maybe its an unsupportive toxic or bigoted family or maybe you feel safer or more provided for and comfortable on campus I see you and appreciate you and hope this break goes so much better than you could ever hope for💗 
Yuki Chiu is the most wholesome person on this campus She is a living ball of sunshine and her hugs are only rivaled in warmth by her smile Shes amazing and Im honored to be her friend even though she can be a little immature sometimes

Life in NYUAD seems so temporary sometimes you know what I mean right people study away have internships and we all have new things springing up as the years continue to go by which is a good thing but its sad at the same time To everyone please take the time to appreciate the gems around you that continue make your NYUAD experience worth it Tag those gems 
Its disappointing to fall for someone who doesnt fall for you But its a whole other feeling of hurt when youre halfway with someone and realsie it If you dont want to be with someone why dont you just let them know I hear so many of my friends especially male friends convince themselves they didnt reallyyyyy do something wrong More or didnt reallyyyyy lead someone on all because the two involved werent an official Facebook couple after all I mean who even does these Facebook updates anymore
Seriously what happened to human decency Im not talking about hookup situations where both people know or have commucated clearly whats going on But if youre seeing someone especially repeatedly you know they feel it more than you you know you have no intention of anything honestly how can you not take your position as the less emotionally attatched to show this person mercy and let them go Is it difficult to offer them that kindness Is it that easy to be lazy with other peoples emotional wellbeing all because youre unsure or because to you its not that deep 
academic integrity is key
To Koki You are an amazing inspiration and are cute and hot the same time Thanks for sharing your life with me and thanks for being so honest There are so many people that are way too insecure to admit that they have concerns but not you You are down to earth and approachable you just made my day You dont have to look to other people for answers you are amazing in your own way

Seniors dont ever let anyone tell you that you dont have time anymore and that you should make up your mind as to what you want to do postgraduation Life does not surround about that moment of postgraduation it is so much more Take your time take your time to figure out what you want to do how you want to get there and most importantly who you want to be
